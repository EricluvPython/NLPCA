I've been in academe for 39 years and involved in distance learning for 21 years both creating and supporting academic degrees and courses. My university (Colorado State) is known for offering around 40 degrees at a distance with more coming. Growth of distance education has been enormous during my career.Over that period distance education conducted online has become recognized as legitimate and providing a solid education. Yes there are people who still stick their nose up at it but those people are increasingly few. Research and studies for decades have supported the u201cNo Significant Difference (look it up online) which tells us that there is no significant difference in the competence skills and achievement between students who study at a distance and those who study on campus. In fact some studies have found that distance students outperform campus be up front: a campus is a wonderful setting and for students in the traditional 18u201322 age group it has the great virtue of not only educating students but also socializing them helping them get used to living with new groups of people and generally helping them mature and gain life experience. This process is a very valuable aspect of campus life that has little to do with academics and is frequently there are millions of people who are in their late 20's 30's and 40's who have matured can't afford to move or don't wish to move to a campus. They have jobs families and homes. Distance education is a perfect way for them to gain knowledge and skill and to earn degrees that would be out of their reach otherwise.A well designed course is simply that: well designed and effective. Students who take that course learn effectively and can apply that learning.Let me also point out that every student who has studies on campus has had at least one terrible course with a faculty member who should have been shut up in a research lab and never allowed to try and teach students. A lousy course is a lousy course whether it's taught online or face to face.So neither study method has a universal advantage in terms of course quality but distance education has some advantages for adults.You don't have to be anywhere at any time; you get to study on your own schedule.You don't have to give up your job move to campus and live on crackers and peanut butter. You can stay home keep your job and still earn your degree or are in control of the number of classes you take at a time and don't have to conform to the schedule of a campus education also has one you must be disciplined spend time on your studies and do the work. Since you're not going to classes on campus the student has to have to follow through. This is another reason that distance education tends to work well for adults; they generally have the life experience and discipline that younger students may lack.So my opinion on distance learning is this: it's legit it's here to stay and it works for millions of people
I agree that is a great tool for ADULTS who are personally choosing to continue their education who have the equipment necessary for distance learning who have a complex social network outside of an educational institution and who have had the benefit of at least 12 years of direct in-classroom distance-learning for a 5-year-old or an 11-year old or many 15-year-olds is NOT a good idea. Many lessons needs hands-on activities. Many students need a teacher sitting next to them in person to get the support they need to learn concepts. And the value of the social interaction with other people that occurs in the school setting must never be (Responsible parents who home-school know this and set up ways for their children to have social interactions with others).I do not know if most people realize just how many students do NOT have the appropriate equipment to do school work at home. And I am not just talking about having a computer internet service and a printer I am talking about having basic objects to complete science projects or social studies projects. I am talking about homes that have no books no pencils no crayons no pieces of paper.I know that there are children (mostly who do participate in learning But those children do so with very specific parameters in place including parental involvement to insure that the child is doing the work and having all the equipment necessary to complete assignments
Distance learning has become a very popular option among students nowadays because of its flexibility of time place and study schedule. Distance learning comes as a blessing to students who want to study further while continuing with jobs or who might not be able to attend a full-time course for various there are some Pros and Cons which can help you to make a of distance learning. * Allows you to pursue studies along with a job: Many students who opt for distance learning programmes do so because they also wish to pursue their jobs. Distance learning allows the flexibility of keeping a job and also getting a degree Students can study over the weekends or dedicate few hours of the day while also managing their professional lives. * Distance Learning is more affordable: Distance learning programmes cost way less than a full-time regular programme. This is a very economical viable option easy on the pockets. * Time and place as per your comfort: You are the master of your studies. You get to decide how much time you want to dedicate to studies at what pace where and when. * More acceptances by employers: Distance learning programme degrees are gaining more recognition among the employers. In India all distance learning programmes should be accredited by the Distance Education Council (DEC). Employers of different sectors are more open to a distance learning degree and even encourage students to learn while they earn because it adds more to their set of skills and of Distance Learning * No Direct Contact with Faculty: There isn't any fun if you don't have a teacher you can make fun of is there? On a serious note lack of personal interaction with teachers often affects the learning curve for some students. This is one major disadvantage of distance learning. Flipping through voluminous books with no mentor to guide you can be a little overwhelming for some students. * Dependence on Technology: Some distance learning programmes especially online courses require access to the internet. Unless you are comfortable with this medium you will find studying and interacting with your faculty online difficult. * Lack of Discipline: Since you don't have a teacher standing on top of your head reminding you of deadlines asking for your assignments there are chances that you will not take a distance learning programme seriously. You need to be mature and disciplined to take full advantage of a distance learning programme. * It can get Lonely: Even if you're in a virtual classroom that is full of students the lack of personal interaction might make you feel detached and lonely. This can be solved as you get more comfortable with using the internet. * Not All Courses are Available Taught: Another major disadvantage of distance learning is that not all courses can be taught online. For example subjects like M [ ]edicine and Engineering can't be taught online or through distance learning since practical classes experiments etc. can't possibly be conducted over the internet! Some things you've got to do yourself! * Not Valued by all Employers: No matter how good the from where you pursued your distance learning programme some employers will always prefer a candidate who has pursued a regular programme over you.So keeping in mind all the advantages and you can choose whether to pursue a degree with distance learning or not. A lot also depends on the kind of professional field you wish to enter and pursue.Top Distance Learning Universities in India: (as per Colleges in India - Search Institutes University Courses Exams [ ]) * Indira Gandhi National Open University. * Symbiosis Centre for Distance Learning. * IMT Distance and Open Learning Institute. * Sikkim Manipal University. * University of Mumbai.Good luck :

Distance Education through Open University's MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) is designed for experienced cyberians like me who prefer comfortable online or virtual learning environments [VLEs]. Hey I'd be able to upgrade my knowledge and capacity building skills with greater focus at my own pace and even advance technically in my writing career without the usual hassles of commuting to a physical campus.Now one's personal drive or to move forward can help any distance learner accomplish anything anytime anywhere.My DE Ready badge from the University of the Philippines Open University [ ] (UPOU).If you're curious but a bit hesitant on joining the course you can read my short reflection on distance XperitusOut of the Open and distance e-learning (ODeL) experience I can say that we as learners have been assimilated into a culture of quality and of QualityOn quality Terry Anderson emphasized that
My first distance learning position was in the hospitality industry. The manager of the distance learning team started to interact with me and noticed that while I was on another team I had the ability to step users through various software distance learning team was great at creating interactive online modules that stepped users how to use the software. The software was role-based and differed for each type of user based on login.This team recognized that the most important asset to the team was one or more individuals that could step users through u2018how to' team members created interactive and menu-driven courses and printable manuals. We also had an aspect of our team that created the internal help system created in important note about this team is that they created several of the materials into several different languages. This was especially helpful to our users but made it challenging in terms of support and now over 20 years of ID or design experience I love that distance learning affords the ability to reach more people globally interact with more age groups efficiently and be able to track the progress of the audience.Do you agree
It's difficult to answer this question since there are many ways in which distance learning could work. In some of them I do believe and I think there's a reason to in some - not necessarily. Distance learning is a term as broad as eLearning and eLearning is a huge learning in many cases is a must. For instance while trying to introduce a full corporate compliance and the company in question is dispersed you have lean you learning process on distance learning solutions. And there are more and more global companies of course.There are also many ways in which distance learning could serve as an opportunity for both youth and adults in regions which do not have good enough for them to receive a proper education allowing them to be competitive on the job distance learning is a method that's still under construction - now that the methods of social rapidly develop there are also many ways in which they could be adapted for the purpose of distant learning understood as also eLearning. I don't have a stance on distant learning but personally I do believe strongly that using technology for the purpose of effective knowledge is a big thing and worth working on
According to UGC the Degrees Diplomas Certificates awarded for programmes conducted by the ODL institutions recognized by the erstwhile DECUGC in conformity with UGC Notification on of Degrees should be treated as equivalent to the awards of the Degree Diploma Certificate of the traditional Universities Institutions in the country.Just like the world of business itself MBA programs are changing rapidly. Many top-tier business schools offer online MBA's. We live in a world which is more digitized and now there are more remote workers than ever before. All accredited programs are rigorous and demanding. The biggest reason that students choose an online MBA is learning environment is ideal for working who do not want to quit their jobs or satisfying careers to bolster their education. Online MBA programs also tend to be more technology - driven which can help you develop your own technical acumen and of the digital (Deemed-to-be University) has introduced a 2 year MBA offered in the Distance Learning mode.The course is UGC and AICTE approved.The program is designed with innovation and on developing the core management required on the modern business world such as global perspective and leadership - solving skill strategic thinking skill and decision - making skill.The offered are varied upcoming and relevant like Healthcare Management Project Leadership Management Hospitality Management Information Technology Management Data Analytics Advertising and Branding and Digital Marketing & E- Jain University [
Distance learning brings with it many cons that can be briefly listed as follows: * Knocking down borders: You can take courses for distance learning interacting with teachers and other students in any place where you are; * Learner Friendly: Another benefit of distance learning is the ability to take courses at your own pace: is up to the student deciding when and where to follow the classes and when completing the final tests; * Constant monitoring: both teachers and students have the opportunity to analyze the trend of courses with a simple click; * Cost reduction: companies and students will save money compared to frontal courses and lessons; * Appeal: lessons can be supplemented with audio animation and video making the course more interesting and more interactive; * Flexibility: being completely digitalised distance learning courses can be modified and updated there are more pros than cons. The only cons are probably the lack of interaction with students or teachers and the lack of personal knowledge in the fields.If you are curious about e-learning you can check out our journal here ud83dudc49 Everything about eLearning | JOurnal | VITECO [

You may know that Google is tracking you but most people don't realize the extent of it. Luckily there are simple steps you can take to dramatically reduce Google's tracking
But first what exactly are they tracking? Unlike searching on
DuckDuckG
when you search on Google they
keep your search history foreve
. That means they know every search you've ever done on Google. That alone is pretty scary but it's just the shallow end of the
very deep pool of dat
that they try to collect on people
What most people don't realize is that even if you don't use any Google products directly they're still trying to discover as much as they can about you. Google trackers have been found on
75% of the top million website
. This means they're also trying to track most everywhere you go on the internet trying to slurp up your browsing history
Most people also don't know that Google runs most of the ads you see across the internet and in apps u2013 you know those ones that follow you around everywhere? Yup that's Google too. They aren't really a search company anymore u2013 they're a tracking company. They are tracking as much as they can for these annoying and intrusive ads including recording every time you see them where you saw them if you clicked on them etc
But even that's not allu202
If You Use Google Product
If you do use Google products they track you even more. In addition to tracking everything you've ever searched for on Google (e.g. u201cweird rashu201d) Google also tracks every video you've ever watched on YouTube. Many people actually don't know that
Google owns YouTub
; now you know
And if you use Android (yeah Google owns that too) then Google is also usually tracking
Every place you've been via Google Location Services
How often you use your apps when you use them where you use them and who you use them to interact with. (This is just excessive by any measure.
All of your text messages which unlike on iOS
are not encrypted by defaul

If you use Gmail they of course also have all your emails and contacts. If you use Google Calendar they know schedule. There's a pattern here: For all Google products (Hangouts Music Drive etc.) you can expect the same level of tracking; that is pretty much anything they can track they will
Oh and if you use Google Home they also store a live recording of every command you (or anyone else) has ever said to your device! Yes you heard that right (erru2026 they heard it) u2013 you can check out all the recordings

Why does Google want all of your information anyway? Simple: as stated Google isn't a search company anymore they're a tracking company. All of these data points allow Google to build a pretty robust profile about you. In some ways by keeping such close tabs on everything you do they may know you better than you know yourself
The result of all that tracking is that Google uses your personal profile to sell ads not only on their search engine but also on over three million other websites and apps. Every time you visit one of these sites or apps Google is following you around with ads trying to influence your behavior
It's By allowing Google to collect all this info you are allowing hundreds of thousands of advertisers to bid on serving you ads based on your sensitive personal data. Everyone involved is profiting from your information except you. You are the product
It doesn't have to be this way. It is entirely possible for a web-based business to be profitable without making you the product u2013 since 2014

The Myth of u201cNothing to Hideu201
Some may argue that they have u201cnothing to hideu201d so they are not concerned with the amount of information Google has collected and stored on them but that argument is flawed
for many reason

Everyone has information they want to keep private: Do you close the door when you go to the bathroom or cover your windows when it gets dark? Privacy is about control over our personal information. We don't want it in the hands of everyone and certainly don't want people profiting on it without our consent or

More acceptances by employers
Distance learning programme degrees are gaining more recognition among the employers. In India all distance learning programmes should be accredited by the Distance Education Council (DEC). Employers of different sectors are more open to a distance learning degree and even encourage students to learn while they earn because it adds more to their set of skills and expertise
Cons of Distance Learnin
No Direct Contact with Faculty
There isn't any fun if you don't have a teacher you can make fun of is there? On a serious note lack of personal interaction with teachers often affects the learning curve for some students. This is one major disadvantage of distance learning. Flipping through voluminous books with no mentor to guide you can be a little overwhelming for some students

If you're curious but a bit hesitant on joining the course you can read my short reflection on distance learning

ODeL Xperitu
Out of the
Open and distance e-learnin
(ODeL) experience I can say that we as learners have been assimilated into a
culture of quality and chang

Culture of Qualit
"On quality Terry Anderson emphasized that ""learning- knowledge- assessment- and educational experiences will result in high levels of learning by all He also believes that the ""integration of the new tools and affordances of the educational Semantic Web and emerging social software solutions will further enhance and make more accessible and affordable quality online learning experiences"
Since I have titled this observation as
ODeL Xperitu
[from Latin
experitu
= experienced tested proven] let me say that learning must progress to maturity; to function well as social innovators promoting excellence through Capacity Building and Development. Yes this is the Quality Assurance (QA) principle that defines and determ
"Michael Moore even says that this is a fact of distance education wherein ""teaching is hardly ever an individual act but a process joining together the expertise of a number of specialists."
So
ODeL Xperitu
means you have to TRY OUT the
Open and distance e-learnin
"experience yourself and experiment with it. You'll discover that it is beyond an curriculum because it requires active Though ODeL as a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) has its demands like self-paced learning and group activities it utilizes recent advances in technology and creates an ""opportunity for students to engage in sufficient dialogue."
are included in the programme but online forums are there as well just for learners to experience peer interaction support and feedback. Now self-tests clearly stress the need for quality content and performance standards for ODeL; not only for reports purposes but also as a measuring tool for each learner's progress and most especially for further improvement and enrichment. Therefore everyone is benefitting from these structured processes
Culture of Chang
"On change ODeL offers not only quality content but also a valuable platform for supportive conversation that leads to learning. Anderson asserted that this learning community provides ""social cognition"" thereby creating a"
community of inquir
andor a
community of practic
"that ""support and challenge each other leading to effective and knowledge"
"Come to think of it we are in a digital age wherein ""access to technology is increasing"" and there's also that ""access to an ever-growing body of content."
What ODeL does not achieve in the control of content access must be effectively achieved by the increase of Well interaction with the content is all about its Both students and teachers can question and comment on a certain course they are interacting with but only the teacher as a of the institution can monitor review and update the contents being delivered via ODeL. As agents they are both in control of the content's use
As content providers however teachers or educators consent to the aim of the Higher Education Institution (HEI) and connect
to change and to induce change and progress in societ
.
Thus a better ODeL experience means a far more
generative learnin
. That meaningful education experience as a generative activity means you learn by doing by building one's capacity by learning with other contributors and by reflecting on the content. So it is crucial to incorporate creativity in any style of learning
"And so in ODeL we are assessing how well the student understands the course content material but ""the flow of in online courses [is] much less and according to Anderson teachers ""playing a less dominant role in class discourse can actually support the emergence of greater learner commitment and"
When students summarize the course content in their own words it becomes a learning tool. Who is the connectivist here? Is it the teacher whose job is to facilitate learning? Or is it the learner who is engaged in this cognitive process of constructing a more personal deeper meaning in hisher interaction with the content
This is definitely that
ODeL Xperitu
"where the ""learning environment is learner-centered community-centered and herein you'll experience expertise and learning"
These are the insights that I have gained through ODeL. We might want to add our own conclusion and here is mine:
The student who is fully immersed in learning the content concepts becomes a
connectivis
whose personal perspectives are transformed. The ultimate goal of ODeL therefore is achieved when there is a positive meaningful change in the learner's perception of themselves the content information and the world wherein they thrive to advance that

Our team members created interactive and menu-driven courses and printable manuals. We also had an aspect of our team that created the internal help system created in RoboHelp
Another important note about this team is that they created several of the materials into several different languages. This was especially helpful to our users but made it challenging in terms of support and adaptability
With now over 20 years of ID or design experience I love that distance learning affords the ability to reach more people globally interact with more age groups efficiently and be able to track the progress of the audience

It's difficult to answer this question since there are many ways in which distance learning could work. In some of them I do believe and I think there's a reason to in some - not necessarily. Distance learning is a term as broad as eLearning and eLearning is a huge topic
Distance learning in many cases is a must. For instance while trying to introduce a full corporate compliance and the company in question is dispersed you have lean you learning process on distance learning solutions. And there are more and more global companies of course
There are also many ways in which distance learning could serve as an opportunity for both youth and adults in regions which do not have good enough for them to receive a proper education allowing them to be competitive on the job market
Basically distance learning is a method that's still under construction - now that the methods of social rapidly develop there are also many ways in which they could be adapted for the purpose of distant learning understood as also eLearning. I don't have a stance on distant learning but personally I do believe strongly that using technology for the purpose of effective knowledge is a big thing and worth working on

Distance learning brings with it many cons that can be briefly listed as follows
Knocking down borders: You can take courses for distance learning interacting with teachers and other students in any place where you are
Learner Friendly: Another benefit of distance learning is the ability to take courses at your own pace: is up to the student deciding when and where to follow the classes and when completing the final tests
Constant monitoring: both teachers and students have the opportunity to analyze the trend of courses with a simple click
Cost reduction: companies and students will save money compared to frontal courses and lessons
Appeal: lessons can be supplemented with audio animation and video making the course more interesting and more interactive
Flexibility: being completely digitalised distance learning courses can be modified and updated quickly
Surely there are more pros than cons. The only cons are probably the lack of interaction with students or teachers and the lack of personal knowledge in the fields

I am not comparing distance vs regular education. There are a simple scenario when & how you want to learn
If you have a time to learn by going to regular classes and have some extra money also then go for regular education. In these days many company rejects distance education So regular education is best if you have time and money
Now suppose you need to do a job in your early stages of life and didn't complete education in regular classes due to your job then go for distance education. In this situation you don't worry about your career. Because you got more working experience when you complete your distance education. And experience always matter no matter you have done distance or regular education
Hope this helps

Yes it is worth because when we discuss about distance education. We should always remember that in foreign countries like US UK Canada and European countries these are all developed countries the students of these prefer distance education and side by side doing part time job for their survival. And hence become graduate by doing part time jobs and studies the things is that it never matters that you have completed your education in distance or regular
Matter is that what the knowledge you have gained from their because books which are prefferd in regular and distance are both the same
Only mode is distance if someone is really want to enhanced his her skills or hunger for knowledge then heshe can put 100% efforts
From my point of view mode never matters skills and knowledge matters always. If you are doing it as a knowledge point of view then you always focus knowledge not the mode

I am assuming when you say you are asking about job prospects. If not my apologies for such a long answer for a question. You can treat this as a rant.In Indian context let me share my own story. I completed a diploma (Regular) and started working with an MNC. Side by side i enrolled for a graduation program through distance education thinking that this is even better than a regular degree. How? You are working gaining experience and also improving your completion of my Graduation i worked for another 2 years and meanwhile i was preparing for MBA entrance exams.If you ask me the plan was working fine. Although had to sacrifice my leisure time and study along with the job But still fine.First shocker: When deciding on which MBA college entrance tests to prepare for i got to know that i can't apply for Symbiosis as one of the requirements is regular degree. There might be others as well but don't remember all of them.Anyways i got selected in a Tier-B MBA school better than most of Symbiosis colleges (Not bragging at all).I was able to get a decent placement again in an MNC although an IT firm.Now i am stuck here.Why? Most IT companies do not hire distance learning (Mine did though. May be because it was a campus placement not sure) I have not met any other distance education case till now in my present company .Now It's been couple of years and i am trying to switch but not possible at all. I do get interview calls but never been to an baffles me is that the distance education is not even the last degree. It is graduation and Post Grad is regular.So my advise would be to be very careful and research a lot before you take a plunge.May be this was lacking when i decided to go for it.This is true story. Why anonymous? Not because i am a troll. I mostly do not write but this could be a life altering decision and i don't want someone else to learn the hard way
Employment in India after distance educationIf you have inspired to take education like Eklavya then Technology & Distance Universities will act like Students getting average salary package Rs. 3 lac after MBA from IGNOUu00b7 Distance learning programmes eligible for Government jobs as well.u00b7 Students getting recognition in jobs in Canada UK Dubaiu00b7 Students can apply for Job in banking railways airport PSU'sA major concern that students have when they decided to pursue a distance education degree is the value of the degree with respect to employment Because About a decade ago distance education was of nearly no value in the employment sector. However as the time changes & rise of different platforms of online learning distance education is being broadly recognized in both public and private sectors.From a student's point of view the value of a degree is something that directly proportional to its return on investment (ROI).

For most of them good returns mean getting a good job placement after fulfilment of the education- good return on average salary package offered to MBA graduates (2014-2016) of IIM Kozhikode by top companies in India and abroad varied between Rs. 11.29 lakh and Rs. 18.78 lakh per annum.In contrast the Campus Placement Cell (CPC) of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) offers to its students is ranging from (Rs. 1.8 lakhs per annum) to 3.75 lakh per annum)These Statistics & surveys shows that distance education still has a long way to go but if we take a comparative look at the ROI distance learning degrees don't fare that bad either.On off the chance that we think aboutthe affordable and distance learning programmes offered by open universities like IGNOU then the placements offered by them are actually handsome returns on the investment we put in.Distance learning degrees valid for central Government to notification issued by central government in 1995 all awarded through distance education by the universities are eligible for the purpose of employment to posts and services under the central government but it needed to be approved by the distance education Councilu201d IGNOU Vice Chancellor V.N.

Those not going for the former route will go for distance mode. Remember Symbiosis and SMU (Sikkim Manipal University) have become famous in recent decade only due to the latter trend.Road map (*ideal) :Bachelor degree should be full-time sector :If you wish to join govt. sector than even bachelor degree holders from distance mode are eligible to apply (in majority of the cases except in few courses where full-time degree is required to apply).Pvt. sector :For placement you need a full-time professional degree because good companies aren't keen to recruit candidates with open degrees. The reason is that they may be lacking in soft skills team-player ability haven't been in formal structure education (sitting for 8-hours in classroom) etc.Hence professional degrees must be taken from regular mode.PG or PG Diploma courses :If you are not getting any Tier-1 (very good college at National level) then prefer open on Investment is very poor in education. Candidates are spending 7u201312L to get a job of 20u201325K. Addition of MBA from college will at most double your salary (and will consume 2 years + 5u20137L corpus). You should do PG (after leaving a job) only when you feel stuck (and changing companies over time job experience etc. isn't working) or when you get a Tier-1 college with your choice of course. Else hang on invest in (through opendistance in preparation (UPSC State PSC SSC CGL) :Distance education is boon.

This scenario is becoming more of a reality thanks to the rise of online education. With advancements like faster internet speeds and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms for online learning are projected to improve and provide direct competition to traditional education. With the demand for personalized and low-cost education growing each day there are many reasons why distance learning is a part of the future of why distance learning has become popular :1 Flexibility it provides to both students and professors in terms of time place and college.One can continue with a full-time job and raise a family.2. Increase in technologies that enhance the student's experience . Development of learning analytics and software help the instructors to teach and explain better. AI has also contributed in making online learning a very effective channel.3. Online education is far more affordable than traditional learning has now evolved to offer a more viable and affordable alternative to the traditional learning set-up. With rapid advances in AI online students can now receive personalized and structured one-on-one education anytime anywhere. These reasons above indicate that we will see distance learning take a strong foothold in the education industry in the near future.Jain University) has introduced a 2 year MBA offered in the Distance Learning mode.The program is designed with innovation and on developing the core management required on the modern business world such as global perspective and leadership - solving skill strategic thinking skill and decision - making skill.Hope this helps answer your Jain University [
If I understand your question correctly I think you mean to ask whether distance education (DE) provides jobs on completion or are you asking if distance education is even going to be an option that people consider? I'll try to answer the question from both aspects. When it comes to job placements institutes like Sikkim Manipal University (SMU-DE) are one of the better places that provide placements for students. More than 670 placements have been conducted till date making students land jobs in reputed companies like IBM Airtel Accenture etc. As far as where the future of distance learning lies in my opinion it's not going anywhere. More and more people are opting for distance education due to time crunches or financial strains. What I mean is many people wanting to do higher studies opt out because they can't quit their current job because of monetary This is where DE comes in. Through options like 247 learning programs like the one u2018s available SMU-DE offers students have access to a portable campus. SMU-DE also offers scholarships to eligible students during each drive. The only thing to keep in mind during all this is that if and when you choose to do a DE program make sure you choose a UGC recognized institutes such as the SMU-DE and Indira Gandhi Open National University (IGNOU) offers as other degrees will not be recognized. So when such institutes are coming up with flexible options like these for students and working you tell me if you think there is a future for distance education
The future of distance education is tremendous given that technology nowadays is highly promising. Since distance learning allows students to work within their own space at their own pace it became a popular choice of learning mode among These enroll in these courses to seek career advancement or to nurture their other skills.Even though it is quite known among working individuals most parents still choose the traditional face-to-face learning for their kids.But with the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases schools are starting to transition to blended learning.In the Philippines one of the schools that offer topnotch arts and technology courses for SHS college and is CIIT more about CIIT Modern Virtual Education or CIIT MOVE here: CIIT Move: The Future of Education [
From my outlook distance education has a bright future. Though there are some drawbacks associated with this method of higher education if certain steps are taken to make it advanced it might flourish to become the major means of educating further.It is certainly a promising option for those who are matured enough to keep themselves motivated and disciplined and because of their financial condition career or location it is not possible to study through the regular Learning is more flexible personalized and as compared to traditional classroom learning.You must read this Distance Education: Transforming Higher Education [ ] to understand the system of Distance Education and its present state
Of course there is a bright future. Education never goes waste! I have been working for last 10 years and I started working after completion of my graduation. And while being in job I did my and few other courses from distance education [ ]. And they have helped me a lot in many ways.It has helped me grow After completing my MBA I got promoted to a senior position which was not possible otherwise. Even if it was it would have taken another 4 to 5 education gives you the freedom of being with your family and studying You can also save your money.But one thing which matters is the college or university which you choose to pursue distance education. There are various universities which are involved in the malpractices like providing fake degrees or providing degrees in back dates. Enroll in a reputed university and if they provide online resources for studying then all the better
Yes distance education has good future. Some reasons being as follows-1 notcall colleges have the resources to teach and hone student's skills. 2 as the importance of work experience and need for job increases the people who are doing job and wish to be promoted will pirsue distance education. 3 cost benefit- this is because when a person goes out of hometown and stays in a payong guest accomodation there are a lot of to it and at the same time the problems that landlord might ask to vacate room right in the middle of semester or during exam as per the whims and fancies of landlord and students not having any backup get stuck up and face lots of hardships in finding alternate room . 4 - many landlords ask for cash to be paid for the rent. This makes the hard earned salary of parents into a black money. Taking up distance education can prevent this.5 Problem of transport. Many a times colleges are far off from where students get hence commuting becomes a problem. Even if you buy a vehicle it adds costs and fear of vehicle getting stolen.6 Ragging
So you think you've drafted a tweet an email a short story or even a novel. These are different forms of but the process of bringing them to fruition has a necessary sometimes overlooked step: editing! Unless you're a professional writer it's unlikely that you have an editor who can review your writing regularly. Here are some tips to help you review your own work
Give your writing some space.
Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you've finished a draft of something? Don't downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes hours or days but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page you'll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You'll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You'll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it's a text or email maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it's a story or essay perhaps you'll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is it will help your writing tremendously
Don't use synonyms
Looking at your work for the second third or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer more uncommon words. There's nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby but try to limit the repetition of long words so your work flows well and doesn't feel too bogged down. At the end of the day you want it to feel true to you and the message you're conveying
Remember who the reader is.
Don't forget your own voice as the don't forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It's a unique time to step in their shoes to make sure your is as effective as you'd like it to be
Kill your darlings.
Don't be scared to remove chunks of your work even if it feels precious to you. If it's a passage that's really tough to part with try saving it somewhere else so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work
Use Grammarly.
Last but not least
Grammarl

In contrast the Campus Placement Cell (CPC) of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) offers to its students is ranging from (Rs. 1.8 lakhs per annum) to 3.75 lakh per annu

These Statistics & surveys shows that distance education still has a long way to go but if we take a comparative look at the ROI distance learning degrees don't fare that bad either
On off the chance that we think aboutthe affordable and distance learning programmes offered by open universities like IGNOU then the placements offered by them are actually handsome returns on the investment we put in
Distance learning degrees valid for central Government job
According to notification issued by central government in 1995 all awarded through distance education by the universities are eligible for the purpose of employment to posts and services under the central government but it needed to be approved by the distance education Counci
u201d IGNOU Vice Chancellor V.N. Pillai said
As per the notification all distance learning diplomas degrees and granted through distance mode by UGC recognized universities are eligible for the central government jobs such as UPSC Civil Services SBI PO SBI Clerk IBPS PO and IBPS Clerk
Distance MBA graduates can also apply for government jobs as full time MBA graduates. They can find suitable for themselves in government sectors such as Banking Railways Airport PSUs etc
Eligible for overseas job
A distance MBA degree in Business can get abroad jobs in export and import shipping consultancy logistics and placement. Another which offers promising prospects through distance mode is IT management. An MBA degree in Media & will put you ahead of the rest
Special Placement cells for distance learning universitie
"The majority of the colleges offering distance education have now established special ""placement cells"" that actively seek to get their students placed in reputed government jobs organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. These placement cells ensure that every single student get help with job placements counselling for employment and even"
It makes a huge difference from where you have finished your distance education. Pick a institution for your distance education course. Most of the times you will get a job depending upon your skills knowledge and hard work. So once a candidate secures a job in any industry the salary income monetary benefit that she gets depends on his her performance at work not on college or university

Is there any future to distance education
Yes
Positive
Due to
decreasing Ro
and
high inflatio
in education sector sooner or later higher education will become To get a PG degree (people will prefer first to do job in pvt. sector save money and return to do PG; trend is becoming apparent). Those not going for the former route will go for distance mode. Remember Symbiosis and SMU (Sikkim Manipal University) have become famous in recent decade only due to the latter trend
Road map (*ideal)
Bachelor degree should be full-time (regular)
Govt. sector
If you wish to join govt. sector than even bachelor degree holders from distance mode are eligible to apply (in majority of the cases except in few courses where full-time degree is required to apply)
Pvt. sector
For placement you need a full-time professional degree because good companies aren't keen to recruit candidates with open degrees. The reason is that they may be lacking in soft skills team-player ability haven't been in formal structure education (sitting for 8-hours in classroom) etc
Hence professional degrees must be taken from regular mode
PG or PG Diploma courses
If you are not getting any Tier-1 (very good college at National level) then prefer open learning
Return on Investment is very poor in education. Candidates are spending 7u201312L to get a job of 20u201325K. Addition of MBA from college will at most double your salary (and will consume 2 years + 5u20137L corpus). You should do PG (after leaving a job) only when you feel stuck (and changing companies over time job experience etc. isn't working) or when you get a Tier-1 college with your choice of course. Else hang on invest in (through opendistance learning)
Those in preparation (UPSC State PSC SSC CGL)
Distance education is boon. With llittle investment + efforts you get a PG or PG Diploma degree (which usually has same value if you apply for govt. job). After doing PG and clearing NTA NET you can apply for lecturer post in CentralState Universities
Future opportunity & of Education
The education has been democratised and is no longer the monopoly of teachers with formal degrees thanks to Internet. You can start your own Youtube channel firm etc. for govt. job preparation andor provide courses (on X XII board exam or any other You can also start coding graphic designing etc. tutorials
So you no longer need a degree to teach. If you teach well you will soon garner the acceptance in community. Hence you just need
to develop proficiency in subject you want to teach (it doesn't matters how you learn it!)

You may know that Google is tracking you but most people don't realize the extent of it. Luckily there are simple steps you can take to dramatically reduce Google's tracking
But first what exactly are they tracking? Unlike searching on
DuckDuckG
when you search on Google they
keep your search history foreve
. That means they know every search you've ever done on Google. That alone is pretty scary but it's just the shallow end of the
very deep pool of dat
that they try to collect on people
What most people don't realize is that even if you don't use any Google products directly they're still trying to discover as much as they can about you. Google trackers have been found on
75% of the top million website
. This means they're also trying to track most everywhere you go on the internet trying to slurp up your browsing history
Most people also don't know that Google runs most of the ads you see across the internet and in apps u2013 you know those ones that follow you around everywhere? Yup that's Google too. They aren't really a search company anymore u2013 they're a tracking company. They are tracking as much as they can for these annoying and intrusive ads including recording every time you see them where you saw them if you clicked on them etc
But even that's not allu202
If You Use Google Product
If you do use Google products they track you even more. In addition to tracking everything you've ever searched for on Google (e.g. u201cweird rashu201d) Google also tracks every video you've ever watched on YouTube. Many people actually don't know that
Google owns YouTub
; now you know
And if you use Android (yeah Google owns that too) then Google is also usually tracking
Every place you've been via Google Location Services
How often you use your apps when you use them where you use them and who you use them to interact with. (This is just excessive by any measure.
All of your text messages which unlike on iOS

If you use Gmail they of course also have all your emails and contacts. If you use Google Calendar they know schedule. There's a pattern here: For all Google products (Hangouts Music Drive etc.) you can expect the same level of tracking; that is pretty much anything they can track they will
Oh and if you use Google Home they also store a live recording of every command you (or anyone else) has ever said to your device! Yes you heard that right (erru2026 they heard it) u2013 you can check out all the recordings

Why does Google want all of your information anyway? Simple: as stated Google isn't a search company anymore they're a tracking company. All of these data points allow Google to build a pretty robust profile about you. In some ways by keeping such close tabs on everything you do they may know you better than you know yourself
The result of all that tracking is that Google uses your personal profile to sell ads not only on their search engine but also on over three million other websites and apps. Every time you visit one of these sites or apps Google is following you around with ads trying to influence your behavior
It's By allowing Google to collect all this info you are allowing hundreds of thousands of advertisers to bid on serving you ads based on your sensitive personal data. Everyone involved is profiting from your information except you. You are the product

Everyone has information they want to keep private: Do you close the door when you go to the bathroom or cover your windows when it gets dark? Privacy is about control over our personal information.

What does Google know about me
If I understand your question correctly I think you mean to ask whether distance education (DE) provides jobs on completion or are you asking if distance education is even going to be an option that people consider? I'll try to answer the question from both aspects. When it comes to job placements institutes like Sikkim Manipal University (SMU-DE) are one of the better places that provide placements for students. More than 670 placements have been conducted till date making students land jobs in reputed companies like IBM Airtel Accenture etc. As far as where the future of distance learning lies in my opinion it's not going anywhere. More and more people are opting for distance education due to time crunches or financial strains. What I mean is many people wanting to do higher studies opt out because they can't quit their current job because of monetary This is where DE comes in. Through options like 247 learning programs like the one u2018s available SMU-DE offers students have access to a portable campus. SMU-DE also offers scholarships to eligible students during each drive. The only thing to keep in mind during all this is that if and when you choose to do a DE program make sure you choose a UGC recognized institutes such as the SMU-DE and Indira Gandhi Open National University (IGNOU) offers as other degrees will not be recognized. So when such institutes are coming up with flexible options like these for students and working you tell me if you think there is a future for distance education
Is there any future to distance education
The future of distance education is tremendous given that technology nowadays is highly promising. Since distance learning allows students to work within their own space at their own pace it became a popular choice of learning mode among These enroll in these courses to seek career advancement or to nurture their other skills

Of course there is a bright future. Education never goes waste! I have been working for last 10 years and I started working after completion of my graduation. And while being in job I did my and few other courses from
distance educatio
. And they have helped me a lot in many ways
It has helped me grow After completing my MBA I got promoted to a senior position which was not possible otherwise. Even if it was it would have taken another 4 to 5 years
Distance educatio
gives you the freedom of being with your family and studying You can also save your money
But one thing which matters is the college or university which you choose to pursue
distance educatio
. There are various universities which are involved in the malpractices like providing fake degrees or providing degrees in back dates. Enroll in a reputed university and if they provide online resources for studying then all the better
Is there any future to distance education
Yes distance education has good future. Some reasons being as follows-1 notcall colleges have the resources to teach and hone student's skills. 2 as the importance of work experience and need for job increases the people who are doing job and wish to be promoted will pirsue distance education. 3 cost benefit- this is because when a person goes out of hometown and stays in a payong guest accomodation there are a lot of to it and at the same time the problems that landlord might ask to vacate room right in the middle of semester or during exam as per the whims and fancies of landlord and students not having any backup get stuck up and face lots of hardships in finding alternate room . 4 - many landlords ask for cash to be paid for the rent. This makes the hard earned salary of parents into a black money. Taking up distance education can prevent this
5 Problem of transport. Many a times colleges are far off from where students get hence commuting becomes a problem. Even if you buy a vehicle it adds costs and fear of vehicle getting stolen.6 Ragging
Is there any future to distance education
In my opinion (do consult with more people you trust) distance education at graduation level would have a disadvantage compared to graduate full time programs from similar universities colleges. Having said that you can augment some of the distance studies with real work experience if you get an opportunity. After graduation level minimum education level the disparity reduces and your knowledge experience becomes more important.
I am hopeful this would change in not so distant future with more elearning graduate programs from open
Goodluck!!

I believe distance learning indeed has value. This of course depends on what value it is that one is looking for.For me the value may be connected to:-1. Need to use the certificates for sourcing employment2. Applying the knowledge in a job one already has3. Just acquiring knowledge relevant to a particular field.No. 1 seems to be the one where there is a challenge. If the one interviewing a candidate for a job attained their through full time study mode ignorance and prejudice impair their 2 is probably most significant and very critical to the beneficiary especially for people that got on-the-job trainingNo. 3 there is no debate as one is doing it almost like a hobby
Yes of course education has so much value a person who is willing to do education can get admission in top of the university in India that is NMIMS. There are many students from NMIMS who passed out and fulfilling their dreams and wishes for working in many huge companies. Narsee Monjee offers various academic programs such as1. PGDBM (Information Technology and Systems diploma in Marketing Managemen3. Diploma in Supply Chain Management4. Diploma in Retail Management5. Certificate Program in Project Managemen6. Certificate Program in Corporate Certificate Program in Business Management8. Many at Narsee Monjee are so much qualified and and help students to shape their careers in a better way. So if you are still thinking distance learning education has value or not then just for a once count on NMIMS and you will definitely know the worth of studying distance education
The value of the course will also depend upon the experience. According to the UGC all degrees are equal value and for the government services it is not a problem. even Civil service exam also it is counted. but if you want go in management side even public sector companies are not accepting the distance education for management trainee post. all they are asking full time and minimum 60% of marks. At the same time so many universities giving the degrees without any value. so My personnel experience the distance education degrees will not have good worth. But in the case of serving employees in the government sector private sector for promotion prospectus it is use full to do distance education degrees. if the person to start with career with distance education degrees it is some what difficult
Hello as we are growing in every terms accordingly we are even upgrading ourselves with the learning methodology. In the world where theirs neck to neck competition there u need to have certain different skills with which you can survive and be in the race for chasing. So now most of peers pursue regular mode of study till graduation and after that they look for good job with this they continue their studies as well with the help of distance they get access towards digital campus flexibility with examination pattern case studies which helps them to know how theoretical things work in practical life. They get more focused and career even provides you ease in the study mode and with the good work experience you have post graduate or graduate degrees as well. Good exposure towards Corporate environment parallel with education.As you know experience plays important role so many of the companies prefer experienced candidates rather then fresher one so with the help of distance education candidates get good career further detailed information you can get in touch at 972613222
Hello You need to see if it is recognised by AICTE or by UGC. I consider having value if it does following-1 Allows me to apply Govt jobs2 If I get promoted based on distance degree.3 I get lot of practical knowledge to apply on my job.Earlier many jobs recognised the degree for jobs promotions. Now almost no one would give you jobs or promotion. And very few degrees have practical advice to apply on job.On the other hand I know some in marketing which are of tremendous value. Using it you can apply on job.But they are not courses as such. As they don't offer any degree and you cant boast about them
Anyone is adviced to pursue full-time graduation degree and if possible full-time PGMaster degree as it offers real life exposure experice and learning experience and networking if someone is doing a job and heshe want to expand his skills and knowledge to get promotion or change a careerthen distance education can be terms of value and both full-time regular degree and distance education stand equal and to get a good job you need to perform in interview and to get promoted you are required to perform.You should make decision in your feasibility and
As long as you're getting the degree which is recognised by DEB (Distance Education Bureau)then the degree is equivalent to a full time regular degree. The purpose of distance education is to provide study to students who all are not in situation to enroll in a regular college.The motto is also to provide education to a huge number of candidates as the ratio of students and regular colleges is not equal in India. Students pursuing hisher degree course i.e can easily switch to a regular education later like Ph.D or further studies with the distance education degree. It's valid all over in jobsprivate jobs etc. But before enrolling in a distance education degree one should check the UGC DEB DECIGNOU) to check the authenticity of the degree in which heshe going to enroll.Else be coolboth distance and regular degree program is equivalent to each other as per UGC if a person is scoring 70% marks in distance and another one is scoring 60% in regular the distance one will get priority over the regular.All the best!!!
The advances in the technologies is touching humans and no one here is untouched with them .Distance learning is providing a platform for those who have hunger of knowing it is very helpful for the ones who want them to be guided to the path of success by learning what is the best for them . By distance learning not only the studying purpose gets fulfilled thoroughly but the concepts also get clear despite being economical and easily accessible

Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you've finished a draft of something? Don't downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes hours or days but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page you'll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You'll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You'll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it's a text or email maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it's a story or essay perhaps you'll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is it will help your writing tremendously
Don't use synonyms
Looking at your work for the second third or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer more uncommon words. There's nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby but try to limit the repetition of long words so your work flows well and doesn't feel too bogged down. At the end of the day you want it to feel true to you and the message you're conveying
Remember who the reader is.
Don't forget your own voice as the don't forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It's a unique time to step in their shoes to make sure your is as effective as you'd like it to be
Kill your darlings.
Don't be scared to remove chunks of your work even if it feels precious to you. If it's a passage that's really tough to part with try saving it somewhere else so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work
Use Grammarly.
Last but not least

How can I effectively edit my own writing
I believe distance learning indeed has value. This of course depends on what value it is that one is looking for
For me the value may be connected to:
Need to use the certificates for sourcing employmen

Just acquiring knowledge relevant to a particular field
No. 1 seems to be the one where there is a challenge. If the one interviewing a candidate for a job attained their through full time study mode ignorance and prejudice impair their judgement
No. 2 is probably most significant and very critical to the beneficiary especially for people that got on-the-job trainin
No. 3 there is no debate as one is doing it almost like a hobby

We
help answer this questio
for all kinds of every day. Learning management systems (LMSs) bring a lot of value to the table with LMS adoption increasing every year. Here are some of the most important benefits of an LMS
1. Greatly improves your employees' learning and knowledge retentio
There's an interesting phenomenon called the
Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curv
that describes the decline of your brain's ability to retain information over naturally happens to all of us
In the case of workers' retention workers can forget up to
50
of what they just learned within an hour without revisiting the material
Within a day?
70

And within a monthu201
90

turn to LMSs to bridge this retention gap. For example LMSs can drastically improve employees' learning experience by providing tools that embed content types that learners can actually interact with such as creating games and simulations anyone?) or simply turning a page of text into a series of flippable notecards that make your content more tactile and subsequently more memorable
2. Fully accommodates your employees' learning need
You might also be everyone learn differently? How can I accommodate everyone's learning style? It's a fact that we all take in and process information differently and it explains why some people might say they're visual learners while others say they're more hands-on. Thankfully an LMS can improve your entire workforce's learning and retention by facilitating blended learning allowing to mix both classroom and online elements so learners can get the best of both worlds
To accommodate different learning styles and needs LMSs offer a variety of blended learning features. For those that prefer a
self-paced type of learnin
these features include

to sign up for training courses at will
Multi-device suppor
to do training on a computer in the office or a tablet at home
Course deadline
for workers to complete courses on their own by a certain time
For those that prefer more of a
settin
features include
Webinar integratio
for instructors to lead training classes through online video
In-course cha
to ask experts questions on a particular subject
Classroom training managemen
to track offline course materials and assessments
" modifiers"": {""image"":"
3. Centralizes your employee learning hu
With an LMS your training materials and data are all stored updated and accessible from one place. This allows you to avoid all the headaches that come with siloed training materials and logistical planning and focus on providing a high-quality e-curriculum for your generational workforce across your entire organization
One of the greatest benefits with the rising popularity of e-learning and learning management systems is that you don't need all of your employees in one place at one time. Employees can access and get ramped up by your training resources from anywhere at any time. With the future of work being more than ever the added flexibility across different teams and locations is more valuable than ever
4. Reduces your learning and training costs for a better return on investmen
An LMS takes a lot of extra and unnecessary costs out of the equation. You no longer have to worry about repeatedly hiring instructors organizing expensive training days or week-long orientations and running high travel facility and logistical costs. This also helps you save more by reducing overall employee turnover and minimizing compliance risks to name a few leading to a greener bottom line with less time
5. Sheds light on your most critical areas of improvemen
A problem that many face today is the difficulty of identifying individuals who need more attention or topics in your curriculum that need to be revamped
LMSs solve this problem through built-in analytics to track learners' progress and performance and to identify and address learning gaps and For example analytics can tell you things like
Course completion courses seem to be abandoned the most
Common drop-off are courses being abandoned
Object engagement elements in courses are working and which ones aren't

Well I wouldn't say it is completely helpful but Distance learning program has its own advantages. I took classroom course as well as distance learning course for my medical entrance. From what I experienced I felt that distance learning course is better. I'll tell you why because for some students (for example: a student like me!) comfortable atmosphere is necessary to concentrate on the subject. In my 11th and 12th classes I've almost joined every reputed coaching institute. Most of the reputed coaching institutes have a minimum of 50 to 60 students per class and if they don't have that many students then of course we would think it is not reputed as its our psychology to think so. But let me tell you in that crowd you would not be one hundred percent comfortable and you cannot concentrate enough for sure. The other thing is there will be divisions also among the class according to the marks. It is very humiliating (if you are sensitive). The coaching institute timings these days are known to everyone. You go in the morning and come back in the late evenings. There will be huge stress and no time to prepare at all!Now I'll tell you about the distance learning course. You could sit in your comfortable place and jot down every point you are being taught. The other advantage is there are no divisions. There will be different batches you could choose your sessions. It could be morning or afternoon or evening its your wish! There will be immediate response to your doubts in either distance or class room course. So that is definitely not a problem. The classes will be for a maximum of 5 hours the remaining time of the day is yours. You could plan it in your own way there will be no stress and of course lots of time! The best part of distance learning program is time. All you need is a strong will to concentrate. Home is the best place and according to me distance learning programs are the best! Other advantage is every place do not have every reputed institute so most of the students stay in hostels. Distance learning is mainly advantageous to those. All you need is an electronic device and a good wi-fi then you are good to go. Do proper planning and success is definitely yours!Hope my answer was helpful.P.S. I took my classroom course in well reputed Sri Chaitanya Medical Academy and Narayana Medical Academy and my distance learning course in Aakash Institute. I would definitely recommend Aakash Institute either for class room or distance learning course
Distance learningThis form of education entails the use of course materials videos and examinations online. you'll be {able to} be in any a part of the world and still be able to attend a distance learning program from a post secondary of your choice. you also don't need to return to the formal institute on a day to day biggest advantage is having the ability to find out from the comfort of your home or work. no matter wherever you reside you'll get an education from any post secondary institute within the world.The second advantage is that distance learning programs sometimes cost less as compared to regular classroom coaching programs. For people who are working and studying at a similar time this could be a good possibility as their education doesn't considerably use up their earnings and at constant time allows them to gain the required information and skills to advance in their disadvantage of distance learning is that students cannot interact with one another the manner they'd on a campus.Some courses demand formal active training for example courses like cooking and baking or point control ways may be learned effectively solely in an exceedingly schoolroom learningRegular learning or formal schoolroom learning needs students to meticulously attend classes tests and examinations within the college or university they want to be told from. during classroom coaching students need to maintain an exact decorum in their classes and follow all the expected rules and rules as upheld by the post secondary primary advantage of classroom learning is that students get to be told directly from the experts. they'll raise questions directly and will as a result of this have a much better grasp of classroom learning comes with a chance wherever students get to interact with one another and build bonds with and learn from their fellow learning needs regular commitment which means if you're working you'll have to take a leave to attend your learning will at times be a small amount more expensive than the distance learning program
In this environment I believe taking an online course is much better than devoting your time in the conventional classroom learning in the regular course. With education technology there are courses now being run in with the renowned institutes both at global and at the national level. These courses are an add- on to your CV. These online can be accessed from anywhere through internet mediums. While pursuing the you can continue with your job and at the same time complete your course without disrupting your professional commitments! So I think once you have entered into a professional world there is no point taking a break from it just for the sake to pursue a course. Be open and accept the change! Once you are certified your organization will acknowledge the fact towards your dedication in your area of and more importantly that you completed the same without taking a break from your job
There are mixed study findings on that question. Again it depends on the quality of the online course can be one but also brleing aligned to online learning standards( such as Quality matters or INACOL or Consortium of Online Learing or Commonwealth of Learning etc. ). In many cases online learning fits better with learner that merit online learning (time and place independent) some are part of the learner like being introvert more than extrovert or like work or family commitment or living far way.However it saddens me to see the {over) of online courses that are just crap (mainly most of what's on udemy are) sk you need to make sure you get what you pay for.For academic online courses I suggest pursuing ones offered by already established brick and mortar University
Gosh no. This was my senior year and I would much rather be in a classroom. Also both of my parents would have to work during the day so I would have to figure out my own work as well as help my sister with hers. She's having a hard time grasping Algebra (she's doing distance learning for summer school right now) and she gets frustrated whenever she gets confused. Algebra is my favorite subject so I don't mind helping her out (it's better than history or science) but sometimes it takes me awhile to remember what I learned during eighth grade math
I don't know that distance learning is better for my daughter she does a lot better in school with getting her work done I know that at the moment in time because schools are closed probably till September and she doesn't get to see her friends and family till lockdown is lifted I am struggling to get her interested in the work that is set but it's not helped that she has been sent right weeks of homework for every lesson that she has .I have looked through the work and I'm put off how much there is to do. It's a learning curve for everyone at the momen
Distance learning and regular face to face learning are both effective but each has its own constituency of students. Distance leaning works best for those who like to work and do not require the support and of Distance leaners typically have fulltime employment in an area for which their course will better equip them and perhaps enable them to get promotion. They are and will devote about 20 hours a week to study. They tend to be older and have more experience. Because the students are not in college they need to be and are more rigorous and self critical. They don't have others to be critical for them
Suppose you are a sole bread earner of your family or a help to your father in his shop whose presence is mandatory. Foodshelter in hierarchy comes before education. Now if you insist only on regular studies then it may be difficult as you cant leave your near and dear one to suffer and i hope no any man of common rationale with family value can do that.Second part of the story you also know that it is only through by education you can get out of this Page on situation.so [ ] what the option you have?? I suppose this is one answer which you get.Also if you are working in the same field which you are studying will place you in a better position as you know basics of the and you are far better than any person who has just bookish knowledge
HelloA recent study shows that there is a fine line between the traditional study and online study. There is a group who supports online study. It is very beneficial for those who is working and alongside want to complete the study. Students who are not in traditional study support this online education because of its flexibility and They believe that the value of online or distance education is equal to the traditional classrooms. But there is a group of people who think that online education is not a good idea for students. As they do not follow the formal class routines. Before land in to any decision first you have to think about your prime criteria. Why you want to study online? If you get into any job then online study is the best option to continue your study
The one you learn the most from is the Some people learn better by sitting in a classroom for many reasons. Others enjoy the independence freedom and convenience of taking classes online. Working or taking classes online requires much more personal and professional discipline. Another for working or taking classes online is learning or being comfortable with the software tools provided for these environments and activities. However if you like sitting in a classroom in chairs with a whole bunch of other people for a few hours on a regular schedule then the classroom experience is for you

Why online learning is better than in-person learnin
Making changes to education is no simple task. Deviations from traditional learning models are often met with resistance while introducing new technologies or methods often rely on systemic change. Despite challenges
online learnin
is making tremendous progress when it comes to infiltrating all pillars of education from corporate learning to higher education to K-12 schooling. Leaders in these spaces have discovered some significant ways in which online learning is better than in-person learning and as a result we're seeing widespread of connected technology to drive education initiatives
If you're considering moving to online learning solutions it's important to know why. What are the advantages of online learning over in-person learning that is attracting leaders in business and education
Online learning comes in so many different forms
A common of online learning is that it is too static a format for education. Those unfamiliar with
elearnin
may be unaware of the wide variety of ways it can be delivered to audiences ranging from one person to thousands. There are so many different forms of online learning from MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) to
online tutorin
to online components of blended learning courses. Creators of online education material are now designing with individual needs as well as outcomes in mind
Without online learning there is no blended learning
Blended learning is gaining steam within academia and it is moving quickly into the corporate space as HR leaders learning and heads of talent realize its potential. Regardless of the specific type of blended learning we're discussing it has two parts: in-person and online. Without the latter there is no blended learning
Online learning spaces are more capable than physical ones
Online environments are dynamic. They can be instantly altered to reflect new learning initiatives or updated to include new more relevant information. Changing physical learning environments and materials may involve structural change such as a classroom revamp while rewriting traditional education material like textbooks and manuals is expensive and time consuming
Digital is better for impaired learners
We've arrived at an exciting place in development where builders of elearning tech can introduce tools for learners with visual and aural impairments more easily than ever before. For instance in a digital classroom online tutors now have access to a plethora of tools from writing instruments to voice and visual to text chat. These spaces are designed to bend to the needs of different instructors and students including those who may be visually or hearing impaired. On the corporate and academic certificate sides elearning courses are creating new for impaired learners by building software that is compatible with all native features such as voiceover on-screen captions and magnifying tools
Society is digital so learning should be too
We live in a world where nearly everyone carries a connected device almost all of the time. Our workplaces rely on digital technology for success and there are more and more one-to-one schools every year. By learning using the same devices they use in their day-to-day lives and in their jobs students and employees become more equipped for success in all aspects. In other words elearning trains people using the tools and media that reflect society
Elearning courses ensure pedagogical consistency
For large ensuring their people have the consistent knowledge and of the company its culture and its practices is vitally important. This means that educational material must be consistent. online learning delivers the same information in the same format to every single person who takes the course
Flexible pacing and scheduling is better
Whether it's an online course for hundreds of people or an online tutoring session elearning enables flexibility in pacing. If you ask any college or high school instructor they'll tell you that teaching a room full of students presents a significant challenge for finding an ideal pace: some will be too quick for certain students and too slow for others. The instructor needs to find the mean pace but this will at best be ideal for a small subset of the students. Elearning allows individuals to move through lessons at their own individual pace whether fast or slow in order to come away with the same knowledge as their peers. It also helps those with shorter or longer attention spans: stop or start your lessons whenever they like
Integrate assessments and learning tools with online learning
Elearning courses often include interactive exercises designed to help the student learn in an interesting and intuitive way. But where these types of exercises get even more impressive is when they fuse the relationship between assessment and learning tool. Imagine a student trying to identify the different bones in the human body as they appear on his screen all while the software records his time spent and success rate. The result would be an accurate of his knowledge as well as the rate at which he arrived at his end result
Elearning u2013 from personalized one-on-one solutions like online tutoring to large-scale corporate courses u2013 is inherently different and in some significant ways better than traditional learning

turn to LMSs to bridge this retention gap. For example LMSs can drastically improve employees' learning experience by providing tools that embed content types that learners can actually interact with such as creating games and simulations anyone?) or simply turning a page of text into a series of flippable notecards that make your content more tactile and subsequently more memorable
2. Fully accommodates your employees' learning need
You might also be everyone learn differently? How can I accommodate everyone's learning style? It's a fact that we all take in and process information differently and it explains why some people might say they're visual learners while others say they're more hands-on. Thankfully an LMS can improve your entire workforce's learning and retention by facilitating blended learning allowing to mix both classroom and online elements so learners can get the best of both worlds
To accommodate different learning styles and needs LMSs offer a variety of blended learning features. For those that prefer a
self-paced type of learnin
these features include

to sign up for training courses at will
Multi-device suppor
to do training on a computer in the office or a tablet at home

For those that prefer more of a

3. Centralizes your employee learning hu
With an LMS your training materials and data are all stored updated and accessible from one place. This allows you to avoid all the headaches that come with siloed training materials and logistical planning and focus on providing a high-quality e-curriculum for your generational workforce across your entire organization
One of the greatest benefits with the rising popularity of e-learning and learning management systems is that you don't need all of your employees in one place at one time. Employees can access and get ramped up by your training resources from anywhere at any time. With the future of work being more than ever the added flexibility across different teams and locations is more valuable than ever
4. Reduces your learning and training costs for a better return on investmen
An LMS takes a lot of extra and unnecessary costs out of the equation. You no longer have to worry about repeatedly hiring instructors organizing expensive training days or week-long orientations and running high travel facility and logistical costs. This also helps you save more by reducing overall employee turnover and minimizing compliance risks to name a few leading to a greener bottom line with less time
5. Sheds light on your most critical areas of improvemen
A problem that many face today is the difficulty of identifying individuals who need more attention or topics in your curriculum that need to be revamped
LMSs solve this problem through built-in analytics to track learners' progress and performance and to identify and address learning gaps and For example analytics can tell you things like

Why use an LMS
I am assuming when you say you are asking about job prospects. If not my apologies for such a long answer for a question. You can treat this as a rant
In Indian context let me share my own story. I completed a diploma (Regular) and started working with an MNC. Side by side i enrolled for a graduation program through distance education thinking that this is even better than a regular degree. How? You are working gaining experience and also improving your completion of my Graduation i worked for another 2 years and meanwhile i was preparing for MBA entrance exams
If you ask me the plan was working fine. Although had to sacrifice my leisure time and study along with the job But still fine
First shocker: When deciding on which MBA college entrance tests to prepare for i got to know that i can't apply for Symbiosis as one of the requirements is regular degree. There might be others as well but don't remember all of them
Anyways i got selected in a Tier-B MBA school better than most of Symbiosis colleges (Not bragging at all).I was able to get a decent placement again in an MNC although an IT firm.Now i am stuck here.Why? Most IT companies do not hire distance learning (Mine did though. May be because it was a campus placement not sure) I have not met any other distance education case till now in my present company
Now It's been couple of years and i am trying to switch but not possible at all. I do get interview calls but never been to an interview
What baffles me is that the distance education is not even the last degree. It is graduation and Post Grad is regular
So my advise would be to be very careful and research a lot before you take a plunge.May be this was lacking when i decided to go for it
This is true story. Why anonymous? Not because i am a troll. I mostly do not write but this could be a life altering decision and i don't want someone else to learn the hard way
Is there any future to distance education
Distance learnin
This form of education entails the use of course materials videos and examinations online. you'll be {able to} be in any a part of the world and still be able to attend a distance learning program from a post secondary of your choice. you also don't need to return to the formal institute on a day to day basis
Advantage
The biggest advantage is having the ability to find out from the comfort of your home or work. no matter wherever you reside you'll get an education from any post secondary institute within the world
The second advantage is that distance learning programs sometimes cost less as compared to regular classroom coaching programs. For people who are working and studying at a similar time this could be a good possibility as their education doesn't considerably use up their earnings and at constant time allows them to gain the required information and skills to advance in their careers
Disadvantage
The disadvantage of distance learning is that students cannot interact with one another the manner they'd on a campus
Some courses demand formal active training for example courses like cooking and baking or point control ways may be learned effectively solely in an exceedingly schoolroom setting
Classroom learnin
Regular learning or formal schoolroom learning needs students to meticulously attend classes tests and examinations within the college or university they want to be told from. during classroom coaching students need to maintain an exact decorum in their classes and follow all the expected rules and rules as upheld by the post secondary institution
Advantage
The primary advantage of classroom learning is that students get to be told directly from the experts. they'll raise questions directly and will as a result of this have a much better grasp of ideas
Additionally classroom learning comes with a chance wherever students get to interact with one another and build bonds with and learn from their fellow classmates
Disadvantage
Classroom learning needs regular commitment which means if you're working you'll have to take a leave to attend your program
Classroom learning will at times be a small amount more expensive than the distance learning program

How is distance learning transforming higher education
"With schools canceling classes how effective will ""distance learning"" be"
I am sorry but I couldn't disagree more with most of the answers here. Distance learners are HIGHLY MOTIVATED get constant feedback collaborate in distributed teams working on challenging projects and engage themselves in a rigorous regime of learning and CRITICAL THINKING. These are the true learners who graduate from real DL programmes with proctored exams at an official venue - not those who drop out. DL is not for everyone certainly not for sheep. The only fault is in the recruiting system and departments should stop recruiting students who cannot succeed
"There is too much unwarranted stigma about ""distance learning"" coming from the United States. Distance learners who are successful are the best learners in my book (those who are not should not even have chosen DL) and that's evidenced by the research (results of which are just a search away). The United States has an entirely different model of higher education that enables shady businesses to offer subpar online education and this in effect has spoiled the otherwise healthy perception DL could have garnered"
This is not possible in say the UK or Australia. The DL programmes in those countries are assessed and because they are offered at PUBLIC (read: government) The DL students that gain admission and get through the rigorous programmes are many times more competent than their on-campus They take the same proctored exams (the US online programmes do not even have exams) participate in individual and group assignments that are submitted through a plagiarism checker and network the same way utilizing online tools
Perhaps the United Folks do not know this but the DL students elsewhere are taught by the same lecturers doing the research and interact with them via e-mail just the way campus students would outside of class. The only difference is that the DL student is 100% and At the end of their programmes they receive exactly the same certificate with the same grade transcript. They also had the same library card throughout the year qualifying them for many student such as Microsoft DreamSpark
If I give you a book and ask you to sit an exam and you pass I am 100% certain that you are an expert learner (and wish my campus students were as competent). If I give you slides and notes alongside as well and you don't just pass but get a good result I know you have engaged yourself. If I record my lectures and interactions with on-campus students and share it with you and then receive e-mails and forum posts from you and you get excellent results in exams I know you would be at the 90th percentile of my on-campus batch
Can distance learning be successful
If you want to write better essays it's helpful to understand the criteria teachers use to score them. Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve even if you are already getting a high grade
" modifiers"": {""image"":"
Development of Your Thesi
A thesis is the essence of your claim you are making the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement
Strong For
A good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement
Styl
Just as your clothes express your personality the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences idiomatic phrases and demonstrates knowledge of vocabulary all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice
Convention
Conventions include spelling punctuation sentence structure and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore because most essays are written on computers these days there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes which can easily be avoided with tools such as
Grammarl
. Beyond spelling Grammarly can also help to weed out other major grammatical errors. Follow up with a close reading of your entire paper
Support and Reference
Finally your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites articles and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism. If you are concerned about quoting your sources
Grammarly Premiu
offers a plagiarism detector so you can always double-check your work
The grades you get on your essays are important but you can never improve your writing if they are the only things you consider. Focus on improving your essays' overall thesis development form style conventions and support. Learning to master these five elements will cause your scores to soar
What are the best tips for essay writing
The main advantage of distance learning is that it allows you to fit your learning around your work and home life
You can usually also set your own pace of study
It is your decision as to when and where you study
It doesn't matter where you live u2013 you can gain a degree from anywhere in the world
As with a full-time degree students may find that they gain useful transferable skills such as planning and research
A distance learning course often costs less than a full-time degree
The downside is that you will not enjoy the conviviality of being on a campus and rubbing shoulders with fellow students on a daily basis
Loneliness and feelings of isolation should be avoided however by frequent online contact with tutors and taking part in virtual forums virtual help groups and discussion rooms

What are the pros and cons of distance learning
What are advantages and of distance learning programs
Yes distance education sometimes gives somewhat non-positive impression but again at the sametime gives a positive impression as well
While i was doing my MBA in mode i met a guy who had 2.5u20133 years experience of IBM Daksh support. Lateron he joined some marketting job and earning 25k per month. In two years he earned his MBA and two appraisals making it around 30
He prepared an action plan fot 2u20133 months and in these he got one computer certificate proficiency certificate from local institutes
Then he prepared a quality CV grooming and formal dressing videos on youtube which seriously changed his dressing sense and way of talking
Later he called me to tell that he landed in some marketting jon with 6 lac per annum making it more than 40k per month. Yes distance education worked for him
I was not into that much calcuations but he told me that regular mba takes 12 to 20 lacs from avergar college as well and he will also loose his salary which makes it huge. In distance mode it normally takes less than one lac and can land to a somewhat similar ctc as one holds work experience
Key takeaway here is go for distance education if and only if you can club it with some work experience and additional certificate
Is distance learning good or bad
Classroom learning is more effective than distance learning because:1. Face to face is more interactive than sitting behind a computer or completing a course.2. In a classroom it is faster and easier for students to ask questions get answers and ask follow upclarifying questions.3. In classrooms teachers can detect and react to student problems and form better professional with students. (It's easier to find out if students are tired hungry sick frustrated depressed angry etc.)4. In classrooms teachers can model behaviors and skills more effectively than via or email. (Here let me show you how to do this. Does that make sense? Here is another way to solve the problem. Etc. etc.)5. It is more difficult for students to cheat in a classroom environment. (No open textbooks no Google etc.
Which one is better traditional classroom learning or distance learning? Why
Online learning has gained popularity with more students embracing the trend. Subsequently employers have continually appreciated skills acquired through online studies in accredited universities
However despite the great trend on online master's degrees there is a need to understand the few but critical differences between taking a Master's degree online and an on-campus Master's degree. For example when taking some technical courses that require practical applications the difference is distinct
But on the other hand courses such as an MBA online learning can be advantageous for students especially from developing countries such as in Africa
The major differences are in terms of delivery and flexibility
On that note we can on-campus and online MS degree-based on the two factors
1)
Deliver
When it comes to on-campus Master's studies the students can practice what is taught with the guidance of the tutor. However this is perfect for STEM subjects. On the other hand online studies will require you to carry out practical on your own without the tutor's presence. Similarly you may lack the resources for accurate results
Secondly on-campus Master's studies are interactive on a personal level but for online the interaction is virtual. However both serve the same purpose since you can reach the tutor for help whether online or physically. Therefore the only difference here is how you will interact with your professor
The other important delivery distinction to consider is the issue of cost. It's with no doubt that an online degree is way cheaper than an on-campus degree. This is a major plus for African students with the dream of studying a Master's course abroad. It helps save on flight costs and other On the other hand on-campus Master's studies can be very expensive especially if the student has to travel abroad in search of better higher education
2)
Flexibilit
It's no doubt that flexibility is a critical factor to consider when choosing a Master's program to undertake. For example if you are working and want to finish your Master's studies then you probably need the most affordable and flexible program
On that note we can discuss the difference between on-campus and online studies in terms of flexibility
The On-campus degree course means you will attend classes at a specific time set by the institution. You will also have to travel and work with the provided schedule. On the other hand online studies are highly flexible. You are free to attend classes at your time. The professor will post all required reading materials and give assignments then it's up to you to handle them in your free time. The only condition is to work within the provided deadline. This means you can work earn and still do your Master's course
Bottom Lin
With the increasing number of online universities it is clear that education is taking the online trend. Considering the cost and flexibility it's clear that an online degree is more preferable to an on-campus MS degree. Many students from Africa and Asia have benefited from online studies provided by some of the reputable Universities abroad

"What is your opinion on ""distance learning"" as opposed to in-class learning"
In this environment I believe taking an online course is much better than devoting your time in the conventional classroom learning in the regular course. With education technology there are courses now being run in with the renowned institutes both at global and at the national level. These courses are an add- on to your CV. These online can be accessed from anywhere through internet mediums. While pursuing the you can continue with your job and at the same time complete your course without disrupting your professional commitments! So I think once you have entered into a professional world there is no point taking a break from it just for the sake to pursue a course. Be open and accept the change! Once you are certified your organization will acknowledge the fact towards your dedication in your area of and more importantly that you completed the same without taking a break from your job
Is distance learning better than classroom learning
Do you learn better taking online courses or better in a traditional classroom setting
The value of the course will also depend upon the experience. According to the UGC all degrees are equal value and for the government services it is not a problem. even Civil service exam also it is counted. but if you want go in management side even public sector companies are not accepting the distance education for management trainee post. all they are asking full time and minimum 60% of marks. At the same time so many universities giving the degrees without any value. so My personnel experience the distance education degrees will not have good worth
But in the case of serving employees in the government sector private sector for promotion prospectus it is use full to do distance education degrees. if the person to start with career with distance education degrees it is some what difficult
Does distance learning has value
There are mixed study findings on that question. Again it depends on the quality of the online course can be one but also brleing aligned to online learning standards( such as Quality matters or INACOL or Consortium of Online Learing or Commonwealth of Learning etc. ). In many cases online learning fits better with learner that merit online learning (time and place independent) some are part of the learner like being introvert more than extrovert or like work or family commitment or living far way
However it saddens me to see the {over) of online courses that are just crap (mainly most of what's on udemy are) sk you need to make sure you get what you pay for
For academic online courses I suggest pursuing ones offered by already established brick and mortar University

Gosh no. This was my senior year and I would much rather be in a classroom. Also both of my parents would have to work during the day so I would have to figure out my own work as well as help my sister with hers. She's having a hard time grasping Algebra (she's doing distance learning for summer school right now) and she gets frustrated whenever she gets confused. Algebra is my favorite subject so I don't mind helping her out (it's better than history or science) but sometimes it takes me awhile to remember what I learned during eighth grade math

Is distance learning better than classroom learning
Why is distance learning better than regular courses
Distance learning and regular face to face learning are both effective but each has its own constituency of students. Distance leaning works best for those who like to work and do not require the support and of Distance leaners typically have fulltime employment in an area for which their course will better equip them and perhaps enable them to get promotion. They are and will devote about 20 hours a week to study. They tend to be older and have more experience. Because the students are not in college they need to be and are more rigorous and self critical. They don't have others to be critical for them

What is your opinion on distance learning and are they as effective as traditional learning classes
Hello
A recent study shows that there is a fine line between the traditional study and online study. There is a group who supports online study. It is very beneficial for those who is working and alongside want to complete the study. Students who are not in traditional study support this online education because of its flexibility and They believe that the value of online or distance education is equal to the traditional classrooms. But there is a group of people who think that online education is not a good idea for students. As they do not follow the formal class routines. Before land in to any decision first you have to think about your prime criteria. Why you want to study online? If you get into any job then online study is the best option to continue your study

The one you learn the most from is the Some people learn better by sitting in a classroom for many reasons. Others enjoy the independence freedom and convenience of taking classes online. Working or taking classes online requires much more personal and professional discipline.

It may not be a waste of time but with respect to ROI people who physically go to college and complete their education full time are valued more than someone who has got an online degree or learnt stuff online done some part time course (distance learning) even though everyone learns online since education system of many countries doesn't teach industry relevant skills. It is easier to scam people through online college education (fake colleges or programs) and so there is a risk factor as well. Also it does not simulate a network friendly environment where students can build contacts and get to know each other to socialise or build strategic even if somebody gets 50 Coursera certificates in some area it will be harder for that person to get a job compared to a graduate student with a degree in that domain from a good institute ( physical presence which assures no one else other than that student gave the exams projects and assignments needed to get the degree) Irrespective of who has more college education system will be beneficial if people and companies change their mindset risk factor (scams) is reduced and the platform makes sure that no one else is completing the assessments meant for the student on behalf of them. Online education system has tons of benefits and can save tons of time and travelling cost so if the above mentioned things are taken care of it would give rise to a new era
Who says it is? This sounds like an assumption based on a small local sampling of those taking online courses. My online education increased my skills in my work and it eventually led to a promotion. The only way I can see it being a waste of time is if you don't put forth the effort to do the work in the courses. A degree from a traditional college or university would be a waste of time too if you didn't put forth the effort and skated by with low grades

Thanks for the A2A.I am not going to open that link in order to compose a better reply.In general I guess there are two points of view regarding distance learning. It depends on which out of the two things matter to you - the knowledge or the If knowledge matters to you -Take the example of Coursera [ ]. They have an arrangement to issue an official certificate for some price. In case you're happy with just your course records page as shown under your account when you login that's free.But at the end of the day if its knowledge that matters to you Coursera does its job and it does it pretty well.I don't know about other kinds of distance learning programs but most of them provide some or the other kind of notes or lectures right?Now its up to you to study well.2. If recognition matters to you -Well alright it can't be denied completely that the world around you wants you to explicitly prove that you studied something at a 'good' go ahead and get yourself enrolled in a regular college where people mostly do everything except studying.So I would conclude that its totally up to you and your learning you like a subject study it by any means. Forget the certificates they're made of paper.EDIT: As pointed out by Nitin Aggarwal [ ] employers would prefer someone with a regular programme. True. So maybe get educated for the sake of such employers and then keep learning (via distance learning) to improve your life at the the best
My personal opinion is yes it's a waste of time unless you have be a graduate and your field of expertise is completely different.I went though the article The Advantages & of Distance Learning [ ] I totally agree to the point made : No matter how good the from where you pursued your distance learning programme some employers will always prefer a candidate who has pursued a regular programme over you.As far as Programming Languages [ ] are concerned you really don't need a classroom to study and learn Logic (philosophy) [ ]
Thanks for A2A. Learning can never be wastage according to me. Probably if you are referring to the value of degree it can be a wastage. If you are considering Distance learning then I suppose either you're pursuing a job along side or are unwilling to move out of your city. It can't be generalised that distance learning is wastage. If you are up for learning I recommend you to join a full time course else for distance learning try to get enrolled in a good institute
yes in india it surely is a waste of tim

Regular MBA vs Distance MB
Between Regular MBA from a Tier 3 institute and Distance MBA I always recommend distance MBA
MBA from a Tier 1 institute - The opportunity to connect with a lot of like minded people which you can leverage later makes it special
Almost anyone can do a distance MBA. It's not rate. Understand that rarity is value
Conclusion
Not its not a complete waste. But the value it is going to add depends on you and your and few of those are not even in your control. See how your seniors are progressing. MBA may not be the best way. How about something which is more aligned with what you are doing right now? In depth knowledge in your domain is many times the best way to get into management
Let me remind you something which you already know there used to be a time when you get a degree and then a job was readily given to you. That time is going to end. What can you get done in an organisation is what really matters. So develop your skills. And if at all you decide to do MBA consume updated content online along with your curriculum
Is there any value in a distance MBA or is it a complete waste? Does anyone know of anybody who has benefited from it
Is there any value in a distance MBA or is it a complete waste
I am sorry but I couldn't disagree more with most of the answers here. Distance learners are HIGHLY MOTIVATED get constant feedback collaborate in distributed teams working on challenging projects and engage themselves in a rigorous regime of learning and CRITICAL THINKING. These are the true learners who graduate from real DL programmes with proctored exams at an official venue - not those who drop out. DL is not for everyone certainly not for sheep. The only fault is in the recruiting system and departments should stop recruiting students who cannot succeed
"There is too much unwarranted stigma about ""distance learning"" coming from the United States. Distance learners who are successful are the best learners in my book (those who are not should not even have chosen DL) and that's evidenced by the research (results of which are just a search away). The United States has an entirely different model of higher education that enables shady businesses to offer subpar online education and this in effect has spoiled the otherwise healthy perception DL could have garnered"
This is not possible in say the UK or Australia. The DL programmes in those countries are assessed and because they are offered at PUBLIC (read: government) The DL students that gain admission and get through the rigorous programmes are many times more competent than their on-campus They take the same proctored exams (the US online programmes do not even have exams) participate in individual and group assignments that are submitted through a plagiarism checker and network the same way utilizing online tools
Perhaps the United Folks do not know this but the DL students elsewhere are taught by the same lecturers doing the research and interact with them via e-mail just the way campus students would outside of class. The only difference is that the DL student is 100% and At the end of their programmes they receive exactly the same certificate with the same grade transcript. They also had the same library card throughout the year qualifying them for many student such as Microsoft DreamSpark
If I give you a book and ask you to sit an exam and you pass I am 100% certain that you are an expert learner (and wish my campus students were as competent). If I give you slides and notes alongside as well and you don't just pass but get a good result I know you have engaged yourself. If I record my lectures and interactions with on-campus students and share it with you and then receive e-mails and forum posts from you and you get excellent results in exams I know you would be at the 90th percentile of my on-campus batch
Can distance learning be successful
In India for govt. Job prospects it have same value if it obtained from the approved by U.G.C
But it heard that some a very few companies not giving value as much as they gives to the regular education. Its because of they didn't know the worth of the students who did distance education
Distance education students are doing all the things by themselves and they are their in most of their learning. While spoon feeding happening in regular colleges the distance education students day by day hard working in their homes and some times doing the jobs and completing the for those who goes to parallel college or tuition centers) and after all these indigenous and self determined study it very sad that some companies not giving and value for them
They learn lonely in their studies most times carry out small kind of research to solve the doubts that arising while studiesthus have to spend more times for self studying compared to regular. So the distance education students in reality not less then the regular students and they posses as much as the regular students posses and they also becoming strong self sufficient and independent after doing these study activities by themselves
Nowadays it is seen that some higher education Institutions exempting the distance education students from taking admission to its courses. It is very sad and they should provide the opportunity for all kinds of students by conducting an common entrance examination to determine the eligibility for admission for same degree qualified students whether they are from distance or regular education
So in my opinion for a course whether it from distance or regular education the value which determined by the authorities should be the same. And further future of that is solely determined by a common and same type of capability or attitude testing whether by an interview or exam
(sorry that I added lot of my opinions about the distance education which not really asked by the questioner.

Students can fit them around their existing and commitments and can engage with multimedia content and learning materials at whatever time is most convenient to them. Even better: they don't have to travel anywhere to study they can simply log in to the virtual campus from the comfort of their own home or a second reason why online learning has become so popular: it's cheaper. Cost can often be a prohibitive factor in why individual students don't enrol in courses they're interested in. This is also an issue for corporations who wish to encourage their employees to undergo further training but don't have much of a budget for conferences and training courses. Online courses are easily accessible on much smaller budgets.In addition to the convenience and the cost a large number of students are turning to online learning courses because they have become a better way to learn. Those students who are serious about improving their learning new skills and gaining valuable are keen to enrol in the type of course that will be the most Students learn more than they do in traditional coursesIBM have found that participants learn five times more material in online learning courses using multimedia content than in traditional face to face online courses give students full control over their own learning students are able to work at their own speed. Generally students work faster than they would do otherwise and take in more information. They are able to move faster through areas of the course they feel comfortable with but slower through those that they need a little more time on.#2. Retention rates are higher with online learningMany offline courses struggle to retain students throughout the length of the course. The Research Institute of America have found that this is not the case with eLearning. Rather online courses have increased student retention rates from anything from 25% to 60%.It's been suggested that more engaging multimedia content more control over how they take in the material and less likelihood of classes clashing with other commitments all contribute to this rise.#3. Online learning requires less of a time students are put off enrolling in a face to face course due to the time investment it will require. This generally involves the time to get back and forth to classes plus the time spent waiting for tutors and other students. A Brandon Hall report on eLearning within corporations found that this style of learning typically requires 40-60% less employee time than learning in a traditional classroom setting.It's also key to note that eLearning options generally allow students to split the time they are investing in the course in whichever way works for them. They don't need to be able to dedicate large chunks of time to the course: it'll work just as well if they can set aside half an hour from their lunch break each day.#4. More frequent assessments can reduce of the great things about online courses is that assessment can become more of an ongoing process. This is good news for students as multimedia content and learning materials with regular short tests can improve student engagement. In fact research from Harvard showed that using these short regular tests halved student distraction tripled note-taking and students' overall retention of the content also worth noting that the mort often students are assessed the better their tutors are able to keep track of their progress. Increased student tracking means that tutors are able to step in earlier when assistance is needed.#5. eLearning is the greener optionOnline learning is certainly the more effective option for students but it's also better for the Open University in Britain have found that online courses equate to an average of 90% less energy and 85% fewer CO2 emissions per student than traditional in person courses.This certainly makes online learning and multimedia content a more effective method of education overall. Promoting and engaging in this kind of learning can help both individuals and corporations to do their bit for the environment and stick to their own personal goals.Interested in finding out more about the most effective way to learn languages? eLearning courses utilise high quality multimedia content to increase student and provide an impressive virtually immersive experience
The culture of online education has suddenly boomed in the past few years and has become a serious threat to traditional education system. Though there are advantages and in both but I see online education as the future of I too attended a lot of online lectures and through my experience of online education with Edu4Sure I would like to write down my of programs and courses: No matter what students study from nursing to neuroscience they can find the courses or programs they need online. Students can also earn every academic degree online from a career certificate to a total costs: Online programs prove a more affordable option than traditional colleges. Though not all online degrees offer less expensive net tuition prices than traditional colleges associated expenses almost always cost less. For example there are no commuting costs and sometimes required course materials such as textbooks are available online at no cost.More comfortable learning environment: Commercials that feature online students studying in their pajamas only skims the surface of one of the benefits of online education: no physical class sessions. Students listen to lectures and complete assignments sent to them with no need to fight traffic leave work early for class or miss important family in your profession: Even if someone wants to complete a degree it may not mean they want to leave their current job. For most students today increasing college costs mandate that some students continue working while in school. The previously mentioned flexibility of online programs enable students to keep working while also pursuing academic courses look great on a resume: It doesn't matter where your career stands at this moment; an online program will always look good on your resume. It will show potential employers that you're committed to learning and you're eager to obtain more knowledge and new skills. Hiring managers don't see online degrees as inferior to traditional ones. A degree is a barriers do not matter: It has become very easy for students to learn from someone who is a expert in that field no matter how far the person lives.In my opinion there won't be any classrooms after 20 years but education sector would grow at its maximum through online modes.P.S. : I did Digital Marketing course and Power BI course from Edu4Sure
I think they are useful and very helpful for those who don't have the resources (the funds the schedule or the right location) to attend classes in person. However I think that face-to-face learning is far more efficient and effective when possible for several reasons: * It's easier for in-person courses to be more interactive (you can ask questions real-time the teacher can adjust what he or she is saying based on feedback and reactions during the class etc.) * When a class is online you can often go through a lesson while doing something else. It's easier to focus when you are in a classroom devoted to one purpose: learning a particular topic. * Technical problems are common in online courses (e.g. bugs in the online course system glitches problems with your internet connection etc.) and these can affect your learning and your motivation. In classrooms when there's a technical difficulty the teacher can usually notice and address the problem quite quickly. Online you're more on your own.There are certainly more reasons why I prefer in-person courses but I want to emphasize that when organized well online courses can be wonderful resources for learning when a full in-person class isn't an option
I think that online classes like everything have their benefits and flaws. The main thing that they have going for them is the schedule flexibility that they allow. Except for scheduled video conferences all online work can be molded around a student's daily schedule. It's not necessary to wake up early or do school work first thing in the morning. Instead students can balance their day with personal activities and work at any time they like. I've found this very beneficial in taking online classes. The unnecessary time in a normal school day is gone and I often get my work done within a few hours allowing me to pursue my other interests like music soccer and even Quora. However I don't think it's sustainable long-term. For instance it's one thing to end a school-year online and a whole other to start one via online classes. Also the interactions of the average school day are completely lost through online schooling. These help students to develop their social skills something that is arguably more important than the subject matter itself. Personally I miss the experience of with my peers and being able to ask my teachers questions. While I have enjoyed doing online classes recently I realize that at some point I need to be back in an in-person learning environment
The online courses now became an important part of learning for the people in India at least. People do online courses in order to increase their current to get promotionsto get job and even for the sake of knowledge itself.The platforms like Ed XCourse EraUdacity etc are attracting the knowledge seekers around the globe.Their with well known universities like is opening a new gate way to quality education .I myself do various courses online not only educational but related to passion also.The important fact is that most of online courses in India are taken by the graduate and post graduate studentspass outs so right now mostly the people with higher education wants to add an 'X' factor to their enough of Ideal condition some of the problem with online courses are genuine and the rest are actually the problem of the person who does it.First problem is the lack of availability of proper Internet support to the major population in the country so to think about online course spanning to average 5 weeks is among them is students syndrome:The tendency to the work till the deadline don come results in half earned knowledge. Third and the last I think is lack of motivation to complete such courses because once a person gets what heshe wanted to know in the subject heshe leaves the course in between loosing some other useful factswhich can never happen in class where final exam will cover everything no matter you like it or not.Well the solution to the last two problems are easy be punctual be motivated and remain inspired till you don reach to the end.The first one needs a bit of support from government sideon which the brass is concerned too ..Digital India is all about to increase Internets Outreach to every part of Country.I think we will be soon fine with Internet too.Then Online Courses will change the course of the education.
I don't know . But I think it's worth taking by 50% . If u can handle it . I mean when this pandamic hits us m we had to go to each an everything thing in front of a smart device . For a student like me . Going to physical classes was the only way of getting out and being me . And especially in my country this online class things was never practised ever before . Even in the times of terror attacks .. we did go to the physical classes taking up our lives . Putting our lives on a risk.. That Is what these online classes was not working much in my country . But now time . Even though the lockdown was lifted after 3 months. And physical classes started . It was just one week I had the opportunity to attend . They said to close down all the physical classes and schools due to the fear of the second wave of covid 19. So we had to take back and go the online classes . It is now becoming kinda okay . We are getting used to it now

Teaching online is a pleasure. However it wasn't at first. It is high maintenance and requires much more work than F2F classes. The work is different. You can reach a larger variety of people. It requires creativity and design. Far too many professors never learned to teach F2F. They are going to be even worse online. A good online course involves choice for students and focuses far more on delivery of instruction than on little need for lecture in today's educational environment. A professor must plan and monitor access to content. Schooling takes place 247 and the professor's presence is not required. I enjoy developing curriculum. That makes teaching online fun for me
During 1960s my brother who was persuing his DSc in Polymer Chemistry in Berlin told us that a professor in Germany teaches in so many class rooms at the same time through closed circuit came started working on information office - Home office ( SOHO) and so on & so forth.3.I remember a chemistry teacher who taught my son only for 15 day at FIT JEE classes.Amit told that the subject he learnt in those 15 days were more than he did in the entire learning period.4.Let us compare the IITs with so many mushrooming Engg institutions in India.What is the the buildings not the the quality of its faculty.Now imagine the same faculty & same content is brought to these pvtgovt COLLEGES.IT [ ] can happen through the super highway of IT.Or you may call it Online.5.The class rooms may still be necessary for interactive learning & the teachers also may still be there for clearing the doubts if any.But the this the only way to take a qualitative IITs & IIMs is not the limit.it [ ] could be MITOxford as well.Let us think
Is the trend since 2010 most of traditional school try to avoid it but under this uncertain situation is forced in the system. They are more than 10000 esucational plataforms that provide online training and that traditional education in more than 50 years can't make it happen.Open a new way to educate people more efective more updated less time and cost.What cost me 5 years in a traditional University Can be done online on half of the time and with less cost. Same information and reviews remotely. We are loosing the personal interaction online education I cannot make my transition to my actual passive aggressive income that can't be done if I keepind doing my professional university Career u2026..

In addition to the convenience and the cost a large number of students are turning to online learning courses because they have become a better way to learn.

The culture of online education has suddenly boomed in the past few years and has become a serious threat to traditional education system. Though there are advantages and in both but I see online education as the future of education
Recently I too attended a lot of online lectures and through my experience of online education with Edu4Sure I would like to write down my observations
Variety of programs and courses: No matter what students study from nursing to neuroscience they can find the courses or programs they need online. Students can also earn every academic degree online from a career certificate to a doctorate
Lower total costs: Online programs prove a more affordable option than traditional colleges. Though not all online degrees offer less expensive net tuition prices than traditional colleges associated expenses almost always cost less. For example there are no commuting costs and sometimes required course materials such as textbooks are available online at no cost
More comfortable learning environment: Commercials that feature online students studying in their pajamas only skims the surface of one of the benefits of online education: no physical class sessions. Students listen to lectures and complete assignments sent to them with no need to fight traffic leave work early for class or miss important family time
Continue in your profession: Even if someone wants to complete a degree it may not mean they want to leave their current job. For most students today increasing college costs mandate that some students continue working while in school. The previously mentioned flexibility of online programs enable students to keep working while also pursuing academic credentials
Online courses look great on a resume: It doesn't matter where your career stands at this moment; an online program will always look good on your resume. It will show potential employers that you're committed to learning and you're eager to obtain more knowledge and new skills. Hiring managers don't see online degrees as inferior to traditional ones. A degree is a degree
Geographical barriers do not matter: It has become very easy for students to learn from someone who is a expert in that field no matter how far the person lives
In my opinion there won't be any classrooms after 20 years but education sector would grow at its maximum through online modes
P.S. : I did Digital Marketing course and Power BI course from Edu4Sure

In classrooms when there's a technical difficulty the teacher can usually notice and address the problem quite quickly. Online you're more on your own
There are certainly more reasons why I prefer in-person courses but I want to emphasize that when organized well online courses can be wonderful resources for learning when a full in-person class isn't an option
What is your opinion about online courses
The online courses now became an important part of learning for the people in India at least. People do online courses in order to increase their current to get promotionsto get job and even for the sake of knowledge itself.The platforms like Ed XCourse EraUdacity etc are attracting the knowledge seekers around the globe.Their with well known universities like is opening a new gate way to quality education .I myself do various courses online not only educational but related to passion also.The important fact is that most of online courses in India are taken by the graduate and post graduate studentspass outs so right now mostly the people with higher education wants to add an 'X' factor to their portfolio
Now enough of Ideal condition some of the problem with online courses are genuine and the rest are actually the problem of the person who does it
First problem is the lack of availability of proper Internet support to the major population in the country so to think about online course spanning to average 5 weeks is unimaginable
Second among them is students syndrome:The tendency to the work till the deadline don come results in half earned knowledge.
Third and the last I think is lack of motivation to complete such courses because once a person gets what heshe wanted to know in the subject heshe leaves the course in between loosing some other useful factswhich can never happen in class where final exam will cover everything no matter you like it or not
Well the solution to the last two problems are easy be punctual be motivated and remain inspired till you don reach to the end
The first one needs a bit of support from government sideon which the brass is concerned too ..Digital India is all about to increase Internets Outreach to every part of Country.I think we will be soon fine with Internet too
Then Online Courses will change the course of the education.

I think that online classes like everything have their benefits and flaws. The main thing that they have going for them is the schedule flexibility that they allow. Except for scheduled video conferences all online work can be molded around a student's daily schedule. It's not necessary to wake up early or do school work first thing in the morning. Instead students can balance their day with personal activities and work at any time they like. I've found this very beneficial in taking online classes. The unnecessary time in a normal school day is gone and I often get my work done within a few hours allowing me to pursue my other interests like music soccer and even Quora. However I don't think it's sustainable long-term. For instance it's one thing to end a school-year online and a whole other to start one via online classes. Also the interactions of the average school day are completely lost through online schooling. These help students to develop their social skills something that is arguably more important than the subject matter itself. Personally I miss the experience of with my peers and being able to ask my teachers questions. While I have enjoyed doing online classes recently I realize that at some point I need to be back in an in-person learning environment

I don't know . But I think it's worth taking by 50% . If u can handle it . I mean when this pandamic hits us m we had to go to each an everything thing in front of a smart device . For a student like me . Going to physical classes was the only way of getting out and being me . And especially in my country this online class things was never practised ever before . Even in the times of terror attacks .. we did go to the physical classes taking up our lives . Putting our lives on a risk.. That Is what these online classes was not working much in my country . But now time . Even though the lockdown was lifted after 3 months. And physical classes started . It was just one week I had the opportunity to attend . They said to close down all the physical classes and schools due to the fear of the second wave of covid 19. So we had to take back and go the online classes . It is now becoming kinda okay . We are getting used to it now

What are your views about online classes
Teaching online is a pleasure. However it wasn't at first. It is high maintenance and requires much more work than F2F classes. The work is different. You can reach a larger variety of people. It requires creativity and design. Far too many professors never learned to teach F2F. They are going to be even worse online. A good online course involves choice for students and focuses far more on delivery of instruction than on knowledge
There's little need for lecture in today's educational environment. A professor must plan and monitor access to content. Schooling takes place 247 and the professor's presence is not required. I enjoy developing curriculum. That makes teaching online fun for me

What is your opinion about online courses
Quite good overall because they increase access to education for those who might for instance not have the means of or have difficult at home. Anything that increases access to education is good for me
Concerning the lack of contact with people that is certainly an issue. This is why I think online courses are nicest for relatively shorter or certificates (beginners certificates for coding for instance
What is your opinion about online courses
Is the trend since 2010 most of traditional school try to avoid it but under this uncertain situation is forced in the system. They are more than 10000 esucational plataforms that provide online training and that traditional education in more than 50 years can't make it happen
Open a new way to educate people more efective more updated less time and cost
What cost me 5 years in a traditional University Can be done online on half of the time and with less cost. Same information and reviews remotely. We are loosing the personal interaction maybe
Without online education I cannot make my transition to my actual passive aggressive income that can't be done if I keepind doing my professional university Career u2026.. And took me just 1 year to accomplish
What is your opinion about online courses
Online classes are beneficial only when efforts are from both the sides i.e Teachers as well as students.. and a strong mediator is very important which is a good internet connectivity .When these things go hand in hand only then I would say online classes are well enough ud83dude42
But But But.. it doesn't happen The reality is so depressing many students which are from backward areas or low internet connectivity areas are suffering everyone is least bothered about them.. This is done by many educational institutions .. so ultimately my review is.. online classes in developing countries like India won't benefit that much

What are your views about online classes
If you are talking about online providers like Edx Coursera etc they are particularly suited for computer related skills where they may even outperform traditional classrooms. If you are talking about schools doing their teaching online due to lockdown they cannot replace the physical classroom where they learn life skills which is not possible online
What is your opinion about online courses
I personnaly like the idea of online educations as they allow for what perhaps we could call learningu201d - you pick and chose what you want to lear and where you want to lean. You go to the courses as and when you actually feel the necessity for it. Online education market is getting bigger so challenge is to pick goods ones (as in any other business

What is your opinion about online education
It is as it were in online education where you'll be able select from a wide run of schools without being limited by physical remove or boundaries. You're able to select education programs a few of which cannot be available in your region. A few understudies are constrained to require majors in courses that they would not have something else enjoyed since their colleges don't offer what they would have preferred. In other instances some understudies live in rustic ranges far away from colleges of choice. With online education you're able to require the major that you just need and go to college of your choice without major relocations

No way you are losing time. Anything learnt never goes to waste. An excellent example of this was given by Steve Jobs in 2005 in Harvard University. He shared three stories the first he called connecting the dots. Long story short he took a calligraphy course in Reed College and after dropping out of it many years later the same gave him the idea to introduce fonts in speech of his always inspires me to keep learning. Below is the link for above mentioned speech. quote by Voltaire sums it all:
No you are not wasting time but do maintain a regular schedule to attend to the needs of your regular syllabus too. In fact I am going to suggest you to view the video lectures of Prof.Walter Lewin ( Physics) if you have not done that already. Initially they were on MIT OCW but later removed. You will get them on youtube. Particularly two series one on Classical Mechanics and second on Electricity and Magnetism are videos are great knowledge enhancer. Having said so you must realize that there is no end of acquiring it . What I mean is that one should not get carried away
Learning new things is never a waste of time: it keeps your brain sharp helps you see things from a different perspective and makes and even more interesting person to hang out with.However it seems that you are currently looking for a reason why you should study online courses: maybe you should try to find a way to apply what you already know towards a goal and then figure out the knowledge gaps you need to fill to fulfill your objective
I agree with the other answers here.There is no way that you are wasting your time.If anything this shows your desire for self-growth. Any other individual whether it be an employer fellow colleague or others will admire this trait and applaud your efforts to continue to improve and learn new things.Keep going

- My Result: 96.6%
Depends on you and your level of preparation by now. Whatever may it be you can do much much more as 2 months are good enough for CBSE
1. For
Physic
focus on NCERTs and past year papers. Derivations are crucial low hanging fruits. Churn them out from scratch as if you're explaining it to someone else. Don't miss a step. Read understand and write till you can derive the from scratch
2. For
Chemistr
Focus only and only on NCERTs. For chapters like surface chemistry p-block polymers everyday life and stuff like that you really need to know the chapter to its utmost details. There must not be a single line which you miss out while studying. Yet some parts would require knowing which is not in NCERTs like in the chapter of Solid State structures of ionic compounds is not given in detail (rock salt zinc blende); yet CBSE has asked it many times. So past year papers are of great help to practice. Also making notes for chemistry is extremely helpful and I cannot stress this more. I scored 100100 in Chemistry and I hope this adds some credibility to my answer
3. For
Math
you need to know beyond the NCERTs to score well. R.D Sharma is more than sufficient. But just don't entangle yourself into the huge collection of problems in R.D Sharma. You need to respect the fact that you've woken up quite late. There's absolutely no time to master each and every concept. Focus on practicing the solved examples. That would do. Also don't forget the past year papers
4. For

Aman Aloon's answer to Is it tough to score marks in class 12 CBSE physical education exam
#NAME?
Prepared properly for a month or so. I became used to pulling all nighters for 2-3 days in a row. I never slept the day before the actual exam and just went straight to the examination center after mugging up. Though it was really painful and I do not recommend that madness the madness of realizing that you've wasted everything till now. I didn't give Pre-Boards as I was afraid that I would not be able to score even 60-70% and obviously who wants to shatter the image of being a all through your life in front of your teachers
I remember that I was pretty much helpless at that point of time and I can vividly recall surfing details of Improvement examination just 4 hours before the Physics paper. Yet I ended up scoring 96.6%
It's very easy and tempting to write a story which would not only inspire people but would help leave an impression of your u201cheroic actu201d. Believe you me that's not my intention and that's the reason why I began my answer with an important line that it depends on you and your preparation by now. In my case I was a student who was solving Irodov HC Verma A Das Gupta P. Bahadur Solomons etc. before I began to get distracted just 2u20133 months into 12th class. So I had the necessary background and aptitude in terms of grasping many things quickly. But that doesn't mean that if someone doesn't have the same one cannot pull off something as magical as this sounds. One can! It depends on you and your focus dedication and commitment
There are always multiple perspectives of looking at a particular situation. I remember asking questions such as these to myself at times u201cPeople study rigorously by sacrificing the luxuries of their lives for a year and I am sizing up myself to that very task with some 50 odd days in my hand. What do you think of yourself Aman? Who are you? What makes you think that you can achieve something which people normally do not even think of if starting 1u20132 months ahead of the examination
and my answer to questions such as these would invariably be
u201cI agree to the fact that people do study very hard in order to achieve a great result. But that's exactly your challenge Aman. You've to do the same thing in 50 odd days which normally people do in a year. How does one grow? You grow by testing your limits and here is the perfect opportunity to test your limits Aman. You should thank your stars instead that you've been given a late wake up call by the nature as the nature wants you to test your limits to help you grow to help you intensify your inner strength. So buckle up Aman. Get ready for an opportunity for a
The motive behind sharing such personal is that you would need to give yourself the necessary pep talk at times. At times you would need to shut the inner critic down. You would need to help yourself calm down by talking to yourself. At such times you would need your own support and you must be there for yourself. To support yourself. To talk yourself out from your anxiety and fear
So go ahead and start off with a new life :

What are the best methods to avoid wasting time online
It may not be a waste of time but with respect to ROI people who physically go to college and complete their education full time are valued more than someone who has got an online degree or learnt stuff online done some part time course (distance learning) even though everyone learns online since education system of many countries doesn't teach industry relevant skills.
It is easier to scam people through online college education (fake colleges or programs) and so there is a risk factor as well. Also it does not simulate a network friendly environment where students can build contacts and get to know each other to socialise or build strategic relations
Lastly even if somebody gets 50 Coursera certificates in some area it will be harder for that person to get a job compared to a graduate student with a degree in that domain from a good institute ( physical presence which assures no one else other than that student gave the exams projects and assignments needed to get the degree) Irrespective of who has more knowledge
Online college education system will be beneficial if people and companies change their mindset risk factor (scams) is reduced and the platform makes sure that no one else is completing the assessments meant for the student on behalf of them. Online education system has tons of benefits and can save tons of time and travelling cost so if the above mentioned things are taken care of it would give rise to a new era
Why is online college education a horrible waste of time
My classes are online these days. I am not able to concentrate. How can I take classes properly
I'm 15 and want to educate myself via books and online courses. I don't know how to start. How should I go about this
What is an effective way to get the most out of online courses
Why am I wasting so much time at school? I could be doing so much yet I'm sitting in a classroom for eight hours a day doing nothing
I can't stop wasting time. What should I do
It depends on your career objectives and the time and money available for you to attend college. I was a member of the Committee that developed Penn State's first on-line MBA Program. As you might imagine the first question that came up in our first meeting was u201cWhat educational needs will this program meet that are not being met now by other In other words if the University makes the considerable investment of faculty time money and other resources to put a premium program on line who will take it? Some people learn best in face-to-face discussions or want to enjoy the many cultural activities and benefits of living on a college campus. However many others because of work and family obligations can't or simply don't want to spend full- time on a college campus. For them an on-line degree from a great university such as Penn State is a perfect alternative. These programs are equal in academic content are subject to the same scrutiny and and are awarded the same University degree as a resident program. The Program has been continually improved since those early days and is now administered by Penn State's World Campus
We tend to take these things for granted now but just think of it. At the time it went on line anyone anywhere in the world working any shift or military personnel in the field with an internet connection now had access to degree programs taught by by the finest scholars and resulting in a University degree. It is still pretty amazing if you back away and think about it
So is an on-line degree a waste of time? Obvious I do not think so. If you want and need the advanced knowledge and simply prefer to do it on line or have family and work schedules that won't let you return to campus an online degree or certificate program is a perfect solution. Check it out at

No. I believe it is still need to be more rated than that.All schools have to embrace the online education now than ever came to give lessons to all schools that in the lockdown they must find a away to keep the education going. How to do that without the online education and good platform?The answer is that the schools need to implement very strong online education platform that is necessary to keep the education process as well as the whole school operation going even in the worst and unexpected Online Education the teachers and the students can benefit from too many features and capabilities that are provided to not only automate the process but also to improve it in a very efficient way.Today with the online education the teachers can upload the course content for the student to download from their portal anywhere can give assignments to the students and students can submit responses online for the teachers to grade and mark these assignment while the automated grading system will do the rest by calculating all the grades of all assessments together to produces the grading reports so that students and their parents will be able to view from the portal can meet the students online to conduct the lesson sessions using the virtual classrooms capabilities as if and probably better than they are in the face-to-face in class sessions.The whole school operations can be automated online and from anywhere and anytime.A lot of other benefits that the school staff teachers students and even parent can get from the online education. However it's a matter of time for the schools to get into its full capacity by implementing the right online education platform
The one word I would use to describe online education is * by the student who thinks it will be easy (just text the answers from my cellphone) * by the who thinks we just need one professor who can handle thousands of students online * by the professor who thinks he can just upload his power points and put email on auto-reply u201cread the * by people who have seen a class shifted to Zoom remote last March and think that is what real online instruction looks likeGood online instruction is superior to onground because the former can do more however good online instruction is more labor intensive: it needs a smaller class size to work
My view: there is no single rating that describes and strata of education accurately. Whether an individual online course is excellent or pathetic depends mostly on the competence of the faculty in charge with a bit of it depending on the reliability and robustness of the there is no reason why online study can't be equivalent to in-person in most cases. The exceptions are in areas where psychomotor skills involving physical contact are involved. I have a former student who just started studying medfical massage; I don't think you learn that online. Similarly if I was having blood drawn and I discovered my phlebotomist had studied 100% online I'd leave and get it drawn elsewhere

The offline method definitely has a lot of flaws which are resolved by the online coaching centres. The online way offers way more flexibility.
